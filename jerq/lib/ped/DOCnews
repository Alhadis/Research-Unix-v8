tped produces now by default the compact encoding that used to be
produced by "tped -c". "tped -c" produces the expanded encoding.
The compact encoding results in better quality drawings but it works
only with dcan and e202 (nd202) and not with aps.
(Thanks go to Tom Killian for including in dcan ped plotting routines)
