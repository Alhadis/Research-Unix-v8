This is the host part of ped.
The only file that needs special attention is Unix.h. When
running on Unix V, change the first line of the file accordingly.
The program assumes that there is a directory where you should
put the documentation (DOC files). The pertinent definition is
	DOC_LIB "/usr/DMD/lib/ped/DOC"
If desired, change the entries in 
	PRIV_PED "/usr/myname/mydir/ped.m"
	PRIV_LIB "/usr/myname/mydocdir/DOC"
The program looks for two shell env. variables:
	TERM (it knows 5620, DMD, and dmd as synonims) and
	PEDOPTS (private or public)
Set PEDOPT=privat, makes ped use th PRIV options from Unix.h.
In that case it also creates a diagnostic file name REC.
