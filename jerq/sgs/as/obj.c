 *	is being generated, and "offset" will be the file offset in the

 *
 *	The data section header is built in "dathead".  The file offset

 *	location in the symbol table, then using the symbol table
 *	element stack (pointed to by symhead) fixst seeks to the
 *	auxiliary entry, and writes the forward symbol table index
 *	found in the stack entry. When fixst is finished, i.e. the
 *	stack is empty, it returns to the original position in the
