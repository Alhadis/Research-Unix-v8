short is short.  int is int.  long is long.  all of these are
on the host machine (the one where adb runs).

TSHORT, TLONG are on the target (where the debugged code runs).
they are used for, e.g., /x vs /X.
TADDR is a core address.  TREG is a register.
there are probably too many of these. 

ADDR is a file address.  like off_t, but probably unsigned.
it is not an instruction address, though it must be at least as large.

WORD is an expression value; returned from expr.  it's also used for
want of anything better for fetches from get?

any of these must fit in a long or there's no hope.
