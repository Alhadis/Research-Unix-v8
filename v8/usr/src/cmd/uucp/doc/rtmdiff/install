Installation
(merely a pointer)
.PP
Initial installation involves
massaging files and directories
in a manner that requires the human touch.
.PP
The files you need will be shipped into
.I /usr/lib/nuucp .
.I /usr/lib/nuucp/init
contains
files concerned only with installation;
.I README
in that directory
has detailed directions.
Skeletally,
you run one shell script
to convert system data files,
another to create the spool directory,
then pick a quiet time
and
.I mv
the
.I nuucp
directories to
.I uucp .
.PP
If you follow the canned directions
correctly,
all the programs will be installed,
and a sensible set of
default data files
will be created.
In particular,
any
.I L.sys
files will be turned into
.I Systems ,
.I L.dialcodes
will be converted to
.I Dialcodes ,
and
new
.I Devices
and
.I Permissions
files will be created.
