Commands
.PP
All of the new commands
have more options
(sigh);
most of the old flags remain.
.Sh
Uucp,
uux,
and friends
.PP
Old
.I uux
had a
.B \-m
flag,
which caused the standard output
of the remote command
to be mailed back.
The new version has no equivalent.
.PP
Old
.I uucp
and
.I uux
accepted both
.B \-r
and
.B \-N
as a request
not to start transferring files
immediately.
In the new system,
only
.B \-r
works.
.PP
The
.I system!filename
syntax has returned to
.I uux .
Hence remote command arguments
which contain
`\c
.B ! '
must be quoted with
parentheses.
Old
.I uux
accepted and ignored
such quoting;
new
.I uux
requires it.
.PP
In the old system,
files could be sent to a user
by copying them to
.I ~user ;
the person named
retrieved them with
.I uuget .
This mechanism has been replaced
by two new commands:
.I uuto
sends files to a user,
and
.I uupick
fetches them back.
The new mechanism is rather slow
and a bit clumsier.
.PP
Old
.I uucp
copied files
to the spool directory immediately.
The new version
doesn't,
unless
.B \-C
is specified.
.Sh
Uulog
.PP
.I Uulog
disappeared in the
Morris version of
.I uucp ,
as it did nothing that
.I grep
and
.I tail
couldn't do better.
(An antique
.I uulog
existed on many 1127 machines,
but it didn't work.)\0
It has been reinstated
in the new
version,
apparently because
the spool directory
has been reorganized,
and it's now rather messier to find
the log file you want by hand.
It still doesn't do much
that
.I grep
and
.I tail
can't.
.Sh
Uustat
.PP
.I Uustat
is very different;
it has a number of flags
and much new functionality
(listing and removing
pending jobs).
An approximation of
the old
.I uustat
may be had with
the
.B \-m
flag
(list the status of many machines,
including some whose status is `OK');
and
.B \-q
(list only those machines
for whom work is waiting).
There's no built-in equivalent
to the old
`\c
.B uustat
sysname;'
use
`\c
.B "uustat \-m | grep
sysname'
instead.
.Sh
Other stuff
.PP
The
.I debug
and
.I kick
scripts
which lived in
.I /usr/spool/uucp
have been moved to
.I /usr/lib/uucp
(mostly for ease of packaging).
`\c
.B Kick
system'
causes a call to
.I system ;
`\c
.B debug
system'
calls with a moderate amount
of debugging output enabled.
