Introduction
.PP
For the past year or so,
various machines in and near Center 1127
have been using a version of
.I uucp
written locally by
Robert T. Morris.
For support reasons,
this version is being replaced
by
the latest USG
.I uucp ,
called ``honey danber''
after its authors.
.PP
This memo is meant to be
an overview of
the important differences
between the `old'
.I uucp
system
and the `new' one.
It is not an exhaustive study,
merely a list of likely trouble spots
and compatibility problems.
Nor is it a complete description
of honey danber.
For more information,
see the manual pages
for the various programs,
and the papers listed at the end.
.PP
An arbitrarily deep familiarity
with the lore of
.I uucp
is assumed throughout.
