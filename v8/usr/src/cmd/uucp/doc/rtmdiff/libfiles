Data in the
.I lib
directory
.PP
Most of the data files in
.I /usr/lib/uucp
have changed their names,
and some have changed their content.
.Sh
Systems
.PP
Names of remote systems
and information about how to call them
has been moved from
.I L.sys
to
.I Systems .
The old
.I uucp
programs searched several
.I L.sys
files
(\c
.I L.sys ,
.I L.sys.dk ,
.I L.sys.local ,
.I L.sys.general );
the new system
has been changed locally
to search
.I Systems.local ,
.I Systems.dk ,
.I Systems ,
.I Systems1 ,
and
.I Systems.gen
in that order.
.I L.sys.general
has become
.I Systems.gen
to keep the filename
short enough
to please
.I namei .
.PP
The format of system entries
has changed slightly,
but most old
.I L.sys
entries
should be OK.
Caller type
.B CMD
has gone away,
and
type
.B DIR
isn't really there anymore;
get help from [1]
if you must cope with direct lines.
.PP
Login chat scripts
are slightly different.
The old system
sent a newline
(ASCII LF)
after each token;
the new one sends
a carriage return
(ASCII CR).
There are now many more
special character escapes;
all of the old ones
are supported
(as well as a few
which have crept into
.I L.sys
even though the old
.I uuco
didn't know about them).
The
.B GARB
and
.B JUNK
magic cookies are gone;
use the
.I expect\-send\-expect
syntax instead.
.Sh
Permissions
.PP
Information about
which machines have what access,
formerly spread among
.I L.logins ,
.I L.limited ,
and a set of unchangeable defaults
(such as stuff found in
.I USERFILE
in other
.I uucp s)
has been consolidated into a new file named
.I Permissions .
There are many parameters which can be set here.
The minimum that must be present is a line
of the form
.IP
.B LOGNAME= login
.LP
for each real user-\s-1ID\s0
which will be used for
incoming
.I uucp .
Note that this means any user who will
run
.I uucico
as a slave;
in particular,
any users whose shell is
.I uucico ,
and the user named in
the
.I uucp
entry in
.I /etc/procctl .
.PP
By default,
only files in
.I /usr/spool/uucppublic
may be read or written,
and
only
.I rmail
may be called as a remote command.
.PP
A
.I Permissions
file which approximates
the old system's behaviour
might look like
.DS
.B
LOGNAME=uucp
LOGNAME=uucpa
MACHINE=OTHER \e
	COMMANDS=/bin/rmail:/etc/asd/asdrcv
.R
.DE
.PP
To allow locally queued requests
to be sent when a remote calls
under (say) login name
.I uucpa ,
add
.B SENDFILES=yes
to the
.B LOGNAME=uucpa
line.
If
.B VALIDATE=hippo
is added,
machine
.I hippo
will only be allowed
to log in as
.I uucpa .
This is similar
to what
.I L.logins
did in the old system,
but somewhat less precise.\(dg
.FS
\(dg
Any machine logging in
as
.I uucpa
will be sent local work;
in the old system,
particular machines could be named.
A safer practice
is to devote a login
to each trusted machine,
or perhaps to several trusted machines
(and no suspect ones).
.FE
.PP
The behaviour induced by
.I L.limited
in the old system
(refuse connection
from systems we don't recognize)
is caused in the new one
by the existence of
.I /usr/lib/uucp/remote.unknown .
If this file
exists and is executable,
it is invoked
whenever a system
not listed in any
.I Systems
file calls.
As distributed,
it is a shell script
which appends the time
and the system name
to a log file.
To allow calls from
unknown systems,
remove it
(or just turn off execute permissions).
.PP
To learn more than you
probably want to know about
.I Permissions ,
see Appendix IV
in [1].
.Sh
Other data files
.PP
.I L.devices
has been renamed
.I Devices ;
its format has changed a bit too.
It must contain the following two lines
for Datakit
and autodialers called by
.I dialout (3):
.DS
.B
DK DK 0 Any DK \eD
ACU \- \- Any Dialout
.R
.DE
Any existing
.I L.devices
is almost certainly obsolete.
If not,
see [1] for help.
.PP
.I L.dialcodes
has been renamed
.I Dialcodes .
Its format has not changed.
.PP
A new file,
.I Poll,
lists systems which should be 
polled for work periodically,
and when they should be called.
.PP
.I L.sysequiv ,
.I L.genequiv ,
and
.I L.netequiv
have disappeared.
