.P
These are the ASSERT error messages that can occur.
The will appear in the error log (/usr/spool/uucp/.Admin/errors).
When the errors occur, the program will abort--the file name,
sccsid, line number will appear in the error message along with the
following text.
In most cases, these result from file system problems;
use the errno, when present to check out the problem.
.P
.VL 23 0
.LI "CAN'T OPEN"
An open() or fopen() failed--``errno'' appears in ()
.LI "CAN'T WRITE"
A write() or fwrite() or fprintf() etc--``errno'' appears in ()

A creat() call failed--``errno'' appears in ()
.LI "CAN'T ALLOCATE"
A dynamic allocation failed.
.LI "CAN'T LOCK"
An attempt to make a LCK (lock) file failed.
In some
cases, this is a fatal error.
.LI "CAN'T STAT"
A stat() call failed--``errno'' appears in ()
.LI "CAN'T CHMOD"
A chmod() call failed--``errno'' appears in ()
.LI "CAN'T LINK"

.LI "CAN'T UNLINK"

.LI "WRONG ROLE"
This is an internal logic problem.
.LI "CAN'T MOVE TO CORRUPTDIR"
.br
An attempt to move some bad C. or X. files
to the .Corrupt directory failed--the directory is
probably missing or has wrong modes or owner.
(/usr/spool/uucp/.Corrupt)
.LI "CAN'T CLOSE"
A close() or fclose() call failed--``errno'' appears in ()
.LI "FILE EXISTS"
The creation of a C. or D. file is attempted, but the file exists.
This
occurs when there is a problem with the sequence file
access--usually a software error.
.LI "No uucp server"
A tcp/ip call is attempted, but there is no server for uucp.
.LI "BAD UID"
The uid can not be found in the /etc/passwd file.
The file system is in trouble, or the /etc/passwd file is inconsistant.
.LI "BAD LOGIN_UID"
same as previous.
.LI "ULIMIT TOO SMALL"
The ulimit for the current user/process is too small;
file transfers may fail, so transfer is not
attempted.
.LI "BAD LINE"
There is a bad line in the Devices file;
there are not enough arguments on one or more lines.
.LI "FSTAT FAILED IN EWRDATA"
.br
There is something wrong with the ethernet media.
.LI "SYSLST OVERFLOW"
An internal table in gename.c overflowed.
A big/strange request was attempted--send it with MR to the
appropriate place.
.LI "TOO MANY SAVED C FILES"
.br
same as previous
.LI "RETURN FROM fixline ioctl"
.br
An ioctl, which should never fail, failed.
There is a system or driver problem.
.LI "BAD SPEED"
A bad line speed appears in the Devices/Systems files.
.LI "PERMISSIONS file: BAD OPTION--"
.br
There is a bad line or option in the PERMISSIONS file.
Fix it immediately!
.LI "PKCGET READ"
The other side probably hung up;
don't worry about it.
.LI "SYSTAT OPEN FAIL"
There is a problem with the modes of /usr/lib/uucp/.Status, or there
is a file with bad modes in the directory.
.LI "TOO MANY LOCKS"
There is some internal problem!
Send in an MR.
.LI "CAN NOT ALLOCATE FOR"
.br
There is some kernel problem;
a call to calloc() failed.
.LI "XMV ERROR"
There is a problem with some file or directory;
It is likely the spool directory, since the modes of
the destinations were suppose to be checked before
the program attempts this.
.LI "CAN'T FORK"
An attempt to fork and exec failed.
The current job should not be lost, but will be attempted later
(uuxqt).
No action need be taken.
.LE
.SK
These are the messages that will appear in the system status file:
.VL 23 0
.LI "OK"
Things are OK.
.LI "NO DEVICES AVAILABLE"
There is no currently available device for the call.
Check to see that there is a valid device in Devices file
for this system.
.LI "WRONG TIME TO CALL"
self explanatory
.LI "TALKING"
self explanatory
.LI "SOME FAILURE"

to be determined
.LI "BAD SEQUENCE CHECK"
If sequence checking is used between systems, the
sequence numbers do not agree. (This is almost never
used.)
.LI "CALLER SCRIPT FAILED"
The negotiations with the modem/network specified in the
DIALERS file did not complete successfully.
This is similar to DIAL FAILED.
I may occassionally fail, but if it never succeeds, there may
be a problem with the entry in the DIALERS file.
.LI "LOGIN FAILED"
The login for the given machine failed.
It could
be a wrong login/passwd, wrong number, a very slow
machine, or failure in getting through the chat script.
.LI "CONVERSATION FAILED"
The conversation failed after successful startup.
This usually means that one side went down, the program
aborted, or the line just hung up.
.LI "DIAL FAILED"
The remote never answered.
It could be a bad dialer or
the wrong phone number.
.LI "BAD LOGIN/MACHINE COMBINATION"
.br
The machine called us with login/machine name
that does not agree with our PERMISSIONS file.
They could be trying to masquerade!
.LI "DEVICE LOCKED"
The calling device is currently locked and in use
by some process.
.LI "ASSERT ERROR"
An ASSERT error occurred--see
/usr/spool/uucp/.Admin/errors.
.LI "SYSTEM NOT IN Systems"
The system name is not in Systems.
.LI "CAN'T ACCESS DEVICE"
The device tried does not exist,
or the modes are wrong.
.LI "DEVICE FAILED"
The open of the device failed.
.LI "WRONG MACHINE NAME"
The called machine is reporting a different
name in the Shere= message.
.LI "CALLBACK REQUIRED"
The called machine requires that it call us.
.LI "REMOTE HAS A LCK FILE FOR ME"
.br
The remote site has a LCK file for this
system.
They could be trying to call us.
If they have an older version of uucp, the process
that was talking to us may have failed leaving the
LCK file.
If they have the new uucp, and they are
not trying us, then the process that was talking to
us is hung!
.LI "REMOTE DOES NOT KNOW ME"
.br
The remote site does not have our name in their
Systems file.
.LI "REMOTE REJECT AFTER LOGIN"
.br
The login we used does not correspond to what
the remote site is expecting.
.LI "REMOTE REJECT, UNKNOWN MESSAGE"
.br
The remote site rejected us for unknown
reason--they are probably not running a standard
version of uucp.
