See the following files:
uucp.D		Administrative manual
		It includes files uucp.D, App*
		(mm -t uucp.D)
Permissions:	an example of a Permissions file. (a default will be generated
		during the installation procedure.
uucp.1c		manual page for uucp
uustat.1c:	uustat man page
uulog.1c:	uulog man page
uucleanup.1m:	man page for uucleanup
uugetty.1m	man page for a getty that permits input/output on a port
uudemon.hour:	hourly demon
uudemon.poll:	polling demon
uudemon.admin:	to send messages about status to the administrator of uucp
uudemon.cleanup:	cleanup demon

Some useful shells:
Uutry:		shell for debugging--starts uucico with debugging option
Nutry:		shell for debugging--starts local directory
		 uucico with debugging option
uukick		same as Uutry except no output
uutry		same as uutry but output on standard out
uutac		output log file in reverse order - assumes a tac (backwards
		cat command exists in your path
uutail		does a tail command on a system log file.
Cvt:		shell to move C. and D. files from /usr/spool/uucp to proper
		place for the new directory structure
SetUp		shell that copies old system files to the
		new places (L.sys etc)

Here are some pointers for converting to the new version:

1- There are some significant changes in L.sys  (new name = Systems) format.
    a-	For direct lines, the first device specification is changed
	from "ttyxx" to "Direct"
    b-	On time fields where the default wait time was specified,
	the ',' must be changed to a ';'
	In addition, the time has a slightly different meaning.
	The retry algorithm is now an exponential backoff with initial
	time (RETRYTIME in parms.h) and max retrytime (MAXRETRYTIME in
	parms.h).  If the ;time field is specified, that will always
	be the retry time.  If it is not given, the backoff will be used.
2- The L-devices (new name=Devices) file must also be changed.
    a-	All ACU lines must have "801" added to the end of the line.
    b-	All DIR lines must have "DIR" changed to "Direct".
  see uucp.D documentation for details.
3- The uucico program no longer searches for a system to call, it
   must be called with a -s option.  A new program, uusched,
   does the search for work and calls remotes in random order,
   by invoking uucico with -sSYSTEM option.  (see uudemon.hour)

Cron entries should be put into crontab for the demons. For example

39,9 * * * * /bin/su uucp -c "/usr/lib/uucp/uudemon.hour > /dev/null"
1,30 * * * * /bin/su uucp -c "/usr/lib/uucp/uudemon.poll >/dev/null"
45 23 * * * ulimit 5000; /bin/su uucp -c "/usr/lib/uucp/uudemon.cleanup > /dev/null"
48 8,12,16 * * * /bin/su uucp -c "/usr/lib/uucp/uudemon.admin" > /dev/null

Note - at least the cleanup one must be started as root since it must
do a ulime

For building the system:
1- Carefully go through the parms.h file to set it up for your
   environment. (see Appendix I for details)
2- make install will create a Permissions file if one does not exist.
   It will also make the needed directories, create some files in INSDIR
   and install the uudemons.
3- The demons also send mail to someone (default uucp).  Change as
   desired.


Other misc:
0- See uucp.D to learn how to set up the Permissions file.
   A default one will be created by make install.
1- There is a new undocumented option for the Permissions file.
   MYNAME=somename.  When used on a LOGNAME line, it will be the
   name reported in the Shere message when someone logs in as
   one of the names in LOGNAME.  If used in MACHINE= entry, it
   is the name used to identify you when you call someone.
