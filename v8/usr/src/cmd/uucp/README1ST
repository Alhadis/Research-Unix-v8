./orig		originals of things that have changed
./unused	junk we're not using
./samples	examples of some of the data files
./doc		administrators manual and other docn
./man		manual pages
./init		useful stuff for very first installation

to install things, first read the manuals in ./doc, but take them with
a grain of salt

our convention is that user uucp group bin owns things.
if you don't like that, change the makefile and the several shell scripts.

to build the binaries: make.
what's here is configured for acus (only).
if you want datakit (or anything else), change parms.h and Makefile;
the paper in ./doc should be accurate about that.

to install things:
su to root
mkdir /usr/spool/uucp
cd /usr/spool/uucp
/usr/src/cmd/uucp/init/setspool
if you have old uucp data files (L.sys &c) in /usr/lib/uucp,
cd /usr/lib/uucp; /usr/src/cmd/uucp/init/setlib

then make install (still as root so permissions come out right)
