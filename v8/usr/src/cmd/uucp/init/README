Read the manual first.  The manual is in /n/bowell/src/cmd/uucp/doc/*.

1.  Copy the new lib directory (this) to a safe place (/usr/lib/nuucp).
It's probably there already.

2.  Copy any of the following files which should be preserved
into /usr/lib/nuucp:
	L.sys* (not L.sysequiv)
	L.dialcodes
	L.cmds
Check them for any junk which can be removed.  In particular, look for
garbage in L.cmds (pointers to commands which don't exist any more,
like uusendda and fget), and for out-of-date (pre-1+ dialling) and
unused L.dialcodes files.  If L.sys.general exists, rename it L.sys.gen. 
(Systems.general is 15 characters, and namei doesn't like that anymore.)

The next two steps (setlib and setspool) should be performed
either as root (if uucp and bin are the correct user and group
for uucp files -- the group will have write permissions), or
as the appropriate user (in which event some specious `Not owner'
messages will appear).

3.  cd /usr/lib/nuucp; init/setlib
This will change old L.* files into new ones: L.sys* -> Systems*;
L.dialcodes -> Dialcodes; L.cmds (and other stuff) -> Permissions.
Examine the resulting Permissions file; make sure it includes all
the user-IDs it should, and that it otherwise satisfies you.

4.  Decide on a temporary new spool directory (/usr/spool/nuucp).
Create it.  Then
	cd /usr/spool/nuucp; /usr/lib/nuucp/init/setspool
This makes some necessary subdirectories, and sets modes and ownership
on the spool directory and the subdirectories.

Stop being root unless you never make mistakes.

5.  cd /usr/lib/nuucp and browse through uudemon.*, hacking to
suit.  Pay particular attention to `mailto' in uudemon.day, and
to the argument to uudemon.cleanu.

6.  You're now ready to install things.  Wait until things are
quiescent, if that's possible.  (Make them so, or don't complain).

7.  Save the old programs from /usr/bin if you're so inclined
(convention: create /usr/lib/uucp/usrbin, and put them there).
Suggestion:
	mkdir /usr/lib/uucp/usrbin
	ln /usr/bin/uu* /usr/lib/uucp/usrbin

8.  The real installation:
	cd /usr/lib; mv uucp ouucp; mv nuucp uucp
	cd /usr/spool; mv uucp ouucp; mv nuucp uucp
	cd /usr/bin; rm uucp uux uulog uustat uuname
	cd /usr/lib/uucp/usrbin; ln * /usr/bin
	cd /usr/bin; rm uuget uuclean

At this point it might be sensible to run /usr/lib/uucp/uucheck -v,
which will print out a sort of interpretation of the Permissions
file, and complain if any important files or directories are missing.
(It would be better to run it before installing things, but it insists
on files being in their final places.)

9.  If there's old work sitting around (J. files),
	cd /usr/spool/ouucp; /usr/lib/uucp/init/cvtwork
will attempt to move it to the new spool directory and mend its format.

10. After you're sure the new stuff works (you might want to wait a
day or two),
	rm -rf /usr/spool/ouucp /usr/lib/ouucp
