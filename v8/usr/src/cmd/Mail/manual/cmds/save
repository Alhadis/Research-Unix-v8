.ip \fBsave\fP
It is often useful to be able to save messages on related topics
in a file.  The
.b save
command gives you ability to do this.  The
.b save
command takes as argument a lit of message numbers, followed by
the name of the file on which to save the messages.  The messages
are appended to the named file, thus allowing one to keep several
messages in the file, stored in the order they were put there.
The
.b save
command can be abbreviated to
.b s .
An example of the
.b save
command relative to our running example is:
.(l
s 1 2 tuitionmail
.)l
.b Saved
messages are not automatically saved in
.i mbox
at quit time, nor are they selected by the
.b next
command described above, unless explicitly specified.
