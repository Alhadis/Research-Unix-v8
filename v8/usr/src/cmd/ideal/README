This is file /usr/cvw/ideal/README.

The makefile in this directory assumes that all necessary
C programs reside in the directory along with it.

You'll need to change LIBDIR in the makefile to reflect where ideal's
library will live.

The only explicit call to the memory allocator is
in a macro tryalloc() defined in malloc.c.
The only explicit call to the memory free routine
is in a macro tryfree() defined in ideal.h.
You may need to use a garbage-collecting
allocator if your machine is small.
You'll notice that macro tryalloc also includes a loop
to clear the allocated node--if you want, get rid of the
loop, and call calloc;
be sure, though, to call calloc with TWO arguments,
the first being the number of nodes wanted (1).

Because of uucp difficulties,
there is a large file--subdirs.cpio--
created with the command cpio -o <subdirectories >subdirs.cpio
You can get them out with cpio -ir <subdirs.cpio

The lib subdirectory of this directory should contain
the library files you'll need--arcs, circles, etc.

The tests subdirectory should contain some tests that
exercise the code quite thoroughly.
The exercise is: cd tests; regress; clean

The idfilt subdirectory includes filters for raw
ideal output to troff, plot, and tektronix terminals.
You'll need to get into that subdirectory to make the
filters (4filt for 4014s, pfilt for general plot,
tfilt for Brian Kernighan's troff to drive the Linotron 202).

The shell command that invokes the ideal processor
with the correct postprocessor according to the
flags described in manpage is in ideal.cmd.
