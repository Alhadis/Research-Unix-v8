The ASCII tables in this directory were built by ../makefonts using
the FONTCHANGES file and the ASCII tables for the Merganthaler 202
typesetter located in ../dev202. The command line that you can use
to reproduce the ASCII tables is,


                   ../makefonts -S..


makefonts doesn't handle the spacewidth command, so you'll need to
edit the CW font file before running makedev. Don't make width changes
in the ASCII font files - instead make the changes in FONTCHANGES and
then rerun makefonts.

For now only troff reads these tables. di10 uses the files in directory
../devcan/devi10. A few of the widths are set differently to try and
improve character placements, although no great harm would be done
if di10 used these tables.
