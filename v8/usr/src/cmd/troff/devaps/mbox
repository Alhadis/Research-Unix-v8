Just sent the APS-5 tables to research!~/bwk/drexler/devaps/ in case you're
interested. The Bell Labs logo is available as \(Lb, but because of problems
with the character we're only offering it in size 36?? We've also got
the 10 line globe and the AT&T available as \(L1 and \(LA in all point
sizes, so you can have the macros build the logo for you.
