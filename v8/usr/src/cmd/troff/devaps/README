Font and device tables for the APS-5 phototypesetter. For the time being
only troff reads these files. The post-processor (daps) that's run in
Jinny's code is forced to read the tables in /usr/lib/aps5/devaps because
the ru character is bad on our disk. If troff and daps read the same tables
all lines drawn with ru would be dashed. If it ever gets fixed we can get
rid of the post-processor's tables.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 1: The width of ru on the R, I, B, and S fonts is 12 units less than
    Autologic's specifications. This eliminates the dashed line problems
    we were having, provided only troff reads these tables.

 2: Added the en character to the I and B fonts so that font positions
    1, 2, and 3 would all be the same size. Told users on other systems
    to remove en from R since it's only used in our banners and that
    seemed to be a less error prone process.

 3: Added xe, xt, and xk to DESC, GB, and GR files.

 4: Set the character code for bs in the S font to 0 so that the old
    Bell System logo will be replaced by white space on the APS-5. Since
    daps doesn't read these tables (when Jinny runs it) we need to be sure
    the same thing is done in /usr/lib/aps5/devaps/S!

 5: Added the new ATT logo characters to DESC and the S font file.

 6: Fixed (probably overdid) the ascender/descender stuff. There's a
    file called KERNING that's got all the required info. It's used
    by fixkern and awk.script.

 7: Added the old Bell Logo to the DESC file and the S font as character
    LB. We were getting quite a few requests for the character from CSO
    customers. Still have \(bs replaced by white space.
