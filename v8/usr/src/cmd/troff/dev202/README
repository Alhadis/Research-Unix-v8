To modify a font, edit the corresponding file
(e.g., H, BI, ...).  When satisfied,
	../makedev <fontname>... 
to make the description files, then
	install (no arguments)
to install it/them in /usr/lib/fonts/dev202/...

If the font you are fiddling is one of the standard
mounted ones, you must also do
	../makedev DESC
(This ought to be automated, of course.)

IF YOU ADD OR DELETE CHARACTER NAMES FROM THE LIST IN "DESC",
YOU MUST RECOMPILE ALL (!) FONTS AND INSTALL THEM.

/usr/202/fonts/tempdir/TOC is a list of the fonts actually
mounted on the 202.
