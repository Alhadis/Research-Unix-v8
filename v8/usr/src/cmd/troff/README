This is both nroff and troff;  "make" makes
troff, and "make nroff" makes (guess what) nroff.
Be sure the remove *.o between these two.
The results are called a.out and na.out, just to
confuse the issue.

This nroff does away with the nonsensical organization
of terminal tables of the previous version.  Terminals
are described with the same language as before but the
files are ascii.  Working examples are in ./term;  the
named parameters at the beginning MUST be present in
the order given.  Character sets can be anything you
want;  see tab.think for a biggish example.

Terminal tables belong in /usr/lib/term;  the names
("tab.xxx") don't collide with the old names ("tabxxx").
