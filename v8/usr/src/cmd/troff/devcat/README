To modify a font, edit the corresponding file
(e.g., H, BI, ...).  When satisfied,
	../makedev <fontname>... 
to make the description files, then
	install (no arguments)
to install it/them in /usr/lib/fonts/dev202/...

If the font you are fiddling is one of the standard
mounted ones, you must also do
	../makedev DESC
(This ought to be automated, of course.)

IF YOU ADD OR DELETE CHARACTER NAMES FROM THE LIST IN "DESC",
YOU MUST RECOMPILE ALL (!) FONTS AND INSTALL THEM.

These files have never really been used,
so take them with a grain of salt.
