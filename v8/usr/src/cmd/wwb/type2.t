     Although the simple sentence is  the  most	 direct	 and
comprehensible	form  for  an individual sentence, overusing
such sentences may make	a document seem	disjointed.  Writing
instructors   say  that	 a  document  is  better  when	less
important  ideas  are  grammatically  subordinated  to	more
important  ones	so that	the grammatical	structure emphasizes
the logical structure.

     This document could be improved by	 combining  some  of
the  sentences to subordinate minor ideas to major ones.  To
do this, join two simple sentences by using a "that"  clause
or  an	adverb,	 such  as "although." Put the less important
sentence in the	subordinate clause after the  "that"  clause
or adverb. For example,	the following sentences

  a.  The simple sentence is the  most	comprehensible	form
      for an individual	sentence.

  b.  Overusing	such sentences	may  make  a  document	seem
      disjointed.

were combined in the paragraph above.  The combined sentence
subordinates  sentence "a" to sentence "b," thus emphasizing
that the  information in sentence b is more  important	than
that in	sentence "a."
