Nominalizations	are nouns that have been created from verbs.
This  program  counts nouns ending in "ion," "ment," "ence,"
and "ance,"   e.g.,  "transformation,  "establishment,"	 and
"admittance," as nominalizations.

     Because nominalizations make sentences hard to read and
add unnecessary	words, you should try to avoid them whenever
possible.  Compare "a" and "b":

  a.  The book is a description	of African wildlife.

  b.  The book describes African wildlife.

Because	of the nominalization, "description," "a" has  three
more words than	"b" and	isn't as direct.

     To	find all the sentences	with  nominalizations,	type
the following command after this program is finished.

		     style -N filename

     To	find all the sentences containing either a   passive
verb  and  a  nominalization or	more than one nominalization
type:

		     style -n filename.
