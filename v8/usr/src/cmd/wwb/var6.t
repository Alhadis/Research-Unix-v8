     This document contains many more complex sentences	than
is  common  for	 this  type of text.  (Complex sentences are
sentences containing an	independent clause [ a sentence] and
a  dependent  clause  [an incomplete sentence],	e.g., "After
the rain fell, the plants grew.") One way  to  improve	this
text  then, would be to	rephrase the most important ideas in
simple sentences, which	will  give  those  ideas  additional
emphasis.
