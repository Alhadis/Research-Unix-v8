     The  _p_r_o_s_e	 program  cannot  check	  the	content	  or
organization  of  your text.  One way to look at the overall
structure of your text is  to  use  _g_r_e_p  to  list  all	 the
headings  that	were  specified	for the	_m_m formatter.  To do
this, type:

		    grep '^\.H' filename

     You can also use the organization program,	_o_r_g, to	look
at  the	 structure of your text.  _O_r_g will format your paper
with all the headings and paragraph  divisions	intact,	 but
will  only  print  the	first  and  last  sentence  of	each
paragraph in your text so you can check	your flow of ideas.
