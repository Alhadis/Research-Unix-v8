/*
 *	ftw - file tree walk
 *
 *	int ftw (path, fn, depth)  char *path; int (*fn)(); int depth;
 *
 *	Given a path name, ftw starts from the file given by that path
 *	name and visits each file and directory in the tree beneath
 *	that file.  If a single file has multiple links within the
 *	structure, it will be visited once for each such link.
 *	For each object visited, fn is called with three arguments.
 *	The first contains the path name of the object, the second
 *	contains a pointer to a stat buffer which will usually hold
 *	appropriate information for the object and the third will contain
 *	an integer value giving additional information about the
 *	object, as follows:
 *
 *		FTW_F	The object is a file for which stat was
 *			successful.  It does not guarantee that the
 *			file can actually be read.
 *
 *		FTW_D	The object is a directory for which stat and
 *			open for read were both successful.  This is
 *			a preorder visit -- objects in the directory
 *			are yet to be visited.
 *
 *		FTW_DNR	The object is a directory for which stat
 *			succeeded, but which cannot be read.  Because
 *			the directory cannot be read, fn will not be
 *			called for any descendants of this directory.
 *
 *		FTW_DP	The object is a directory for which stat and
 *			open for read were both successful.  This is
 *			a postorder visit -- everything in the directory
 *			has already been visited.
 *
 *		FTW_NS	Stat failed on the object because of lack of
 *			appropriate permission.  This indication will
 *			be given, for example, for each file in a directory
 *			with read but no execute permission.  Because
 *			stat failed, it is not possible to determine
 *			whether this object is a file or a directory.
 *			the stat buffer passed to fn will contain garbage.
 *			Stat failure for any reason other than lack of
 *			permission will be considered an error and will
 *			cause ftw to stop and return -1 to its caller.
 *
 *	If fn returns nonzero, ftw stops and returns the same value
 *	to its caller.  If ftw gets into other trouble along the way,
 *	it returns -1 and leaves an indication of the cause in errno.
 *
 *	The third argument to ftw does not limit the depth to which
 *	ftw will go.  Rather, it limits the depth to which ftw will
 *	go before it starts recycling file descriptors.  In general,
 *	it is necessary to use a file descriptor for each level of the
 *	tree, but they can be recycled for deep trees by saving the position,
 *	closing, re-opening, and seeking.  It is possible to start
 *	recycling file descriptors by sensing when we have run out, but
 *	in general this will not be terribly useful if fn expects to be
 *	able to open files.  We could also figure out how many file descriptors
 *	are available and guarantee a certain number to fn, but we would not
 *	know how many to guarantee, and we do not want to impose the extra
 *	overhead on a caller who knows how many are available without
 *	having to figure it out.
 *
 *	It is possible for ftw to die with a memory fault in the event
 *	of a file system so deeply nested that the stack overflows.
