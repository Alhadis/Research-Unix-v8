OPTIONS NOT DOCUMENTED ON THE MAN PAGE

view2d -Tc:
  -B   use blue background
  -SF  download one frame at a time  (hence, arbitrarily long movies)
       GO? s   snaps camera
       GO? 4   skips 4 frames forward;  default=1
  -SMn like -SF, but "snap n" after each frame
  -SA  "autopilot"  like -SF, but keeps going
  -b   don't show blank frame
  -mf file   color map is taken from file, which has n lines (where n is
       the number of colors, specified by -cn).  Each line has three integers
       from 0 to 255 for red, green, and blue.
       For a sample program, see /n/bowell/src/cmd/view2d/makemap.c.
  -mg  use grey rather than color
  -mr  use red to blue, omitting green
  -v   verbose
  -vc    print colors
  -w   warmstart
  -D   debugging   (don't write on /dev/cv0)

view2d -Tp:
   -clx,x,x,x  sets contour levels at x, x, x, and x.   up to 8 levels allowed.

view2d -Th  produces a halftone image on the 202
      regrid -nNX,NY ... | view2d -Th | panther /usr/ehg/bin/half NX NY
  Panther half takes NX=NY=300 by default.
  The default number of levels is 10, but can be changed by view2d -cN.

/n/bowell/src/cmd/view2d/rksmith/rkstri.c
   reads triangle formats and converts to grids

antial -c20 | level -ma    produces antialiased movies

. making movies .
.................

Prepare an outline and makefile as in /n/swift/usr/ehg/cur/view2d/sample.make.
Movies are projected at 24 frames/second; there are 40 frames/foot-of-film;
a standard film roll is 100 feet.

regrid your data files to the desired number of frames

Making a movie ties up the display for a long time;  check with
ehg to make sure you're not getting in somebody's way.

We currently use 7247 or 7291 film.  (The two emulsions are similar, and
  can be processed together.)  Often there will be film already in
  the Bolex animation camera.
Mount bracket using the same two bolts from the Contax camera bracket.
  (Never remove the brackets from the cameras!)
  The necessary 3/16" allen wrench is in the plastic Bolex bag; if it
  is gone, check Joe's drawer in the network lab.
  The high part of the bracket should be towards the rear of the Dunn.
Plug in the cord from the Bolex to the Dunn.
Set switch G on the logic board inside the panel on the right side.

POWER
set f/4; adjust baffle
In dim light (since the film spool is not sealed!), open Bolex case.
Focus using prism held in focal plane
  hit expose button, switch on motor, and focus   (about .32 ft)
   as necessary, turn off motor, then repeat.
  verify that film advance and shutter are working correctly
  (to reset phase of shutter, use needle-nose pliars on drive shaft)
  An eye loupe is in the plastic camera bag.
Stash prism and loupe; reinstall pressure plate.  Do not lose these small parts!
To thread film:
   Be sure that the film winds off the spool as indicated by the arrows.
   "squeeze things together" says Lynn
   turn on motor to verify that film is advancing properly
   replace cover
set two buttons to "normal", hit reset
advance 5 feet using switch on motor drive
  (film footage indicator moves from "ft" to "0")
  may have to hit RESET occasionally as camera self-triggers
hit reset
nohup make&
cut film and send to TVC Labs
     TVC Labs
     311 W. 43rd St
     New York  NY  10036
     800-225-6566
The running purchase order number is 164-802.  Send the invoice to Chris.
Enclose a letter with the negative asking "develop using normal processing and
make a dailies print; return by first class mail the negative, print, spool,
and can to ..."    Your home address is probably faster than the Labs mailroom.
When the print returns, use a split reel and moviola in Lillian's office
to transfer to a normal reel.  16mm projectors are available from CIB x2122.

artistic suggestions from Lillian:
snap 2 is ok;  snap 3 gives noticeable jerkiness
fade up title in about 8 to 16 frames
leave 85 frames for the first line of text, less for extra lines
