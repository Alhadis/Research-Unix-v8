this is derived from the V.2 shell.
	all in the interests of compatibility, etc.
differences between this and V.2 shell:
	restricted shell and readonly are gone
	hash and all its implications are gone
	^ is no longer pipe char
	MAILCHECK and MAILPATH are gone. (see below)
	* matches all files but . and ..
	<<-word is not special
	echo, pwd and test are not built in
	sys Visms such as /etc/profile and ulimit and login are gone
	type is now called whatis, and has different semantics
	whenever a name is printed with set or whatis, it is printed
		in a form that can be re-evaluated to recover original definition
	new builtin 'builtin' always executes builtin version of its first arg
		e.g.
			builtin cd
		does a chdir regardless of any function cd() defined
	[^a-z] matches any character except a through z
		the original syntax is [!a-z].
	functions can be exported.
	"$@" turns to nothing (rather than a null string) if there are no arguments
	{} are syntactically the same as (), rather than words that are only
		recognized at the beginnings of lines
	

differences between this and current shell not listed above:
	functions:
		f(){
			foo
		}
	defines f as a function that calls foo.
	unset removes function or parameter definitions
	$MAIL is checked once every three minutes, as it prints prompt
	you can redirect built-ins
	cd always cd's; there is no question asked if it corrects spelling.
the manual is /n/ikeya/usr/rob/hack/sh/sh.1

dec 1984:
	any char except = or ( may be in a function name
	; means the null statement always
	set -a exports functions
	f()date>x	works
		(was a syntax error)
