BUGS:
	ARGC and ARGV include a - for stdin when there are no args.

WISH LIST:

	%c
	re parsing function of some kind
	save compiled state
	lazy field evaluation
	type decls
	scanf
	access to run-time fcns
	c output, link to c
	char fcns, left side fcns (e.g., lsubstr)
	coercion of expr to condition and vice versa
	begin & end in patterns
	limits on arrays, etc., ought to be dynamic instead of static.


CHANGES SO FAR (Jul 85):

added & in replacement of sub() and gsub();  use \& to quote it

mutiple BEGIN's and END's concatenated

replaced error reporting mechanism

"function" is a synonym for "func"

"delete array[elem]" removes elem from array

Fixed bug in field handling for ~ 25% speed up.

Augmented the getline function:
	getline
		sets $0, NR, NF, $1..., from next input record
	getline x
		sets x from next input record, sets NR,
		but NOT $0, NF, etc.
	getline < "foo"
		sets $0 from file foo.  sets NF, $1...,
		but NOT NR
	getline x < "foo"
		sets x from foo.  no effect on $0, NF, NR, etc.

	Files are as for print; they are matched by name,
	and remain open until explicitly closed.
	Input pipes work;  syntax is
		"whatever" | getline
		"something" | getline x
	(This adds a reduce/reduce conflict
	to the grammar, so it may be a bad idea.)

	getline returns 0 on EOF, -1 on error, >0 normally

Added close function:
	close("foo") calls fclose for right file or pclose for pipe

Added sub(regexp, replacement, str) and gsub(...).
	Substitutes replacement for leftmost occurrence
	of regexpr in str, or in $0 if no str supplied.
	Gsub substitutes for all.  Number of changes
	is returned.

Regular expressions can be dynamic.  Any constant string
	or variable can be used as a regular expression
	in sub(), gsub, or after ~ and !~.

Field separators can be regular expressions, both in FS
	and as the 3rd argument of split().

Added "i in arr" condition, for if (...) and patterns.
	i in arr  is true if arr[i] has been defined.
	Note that this is different from asking if
	arr[n] == i for some i!  We are searching for
	a subscript, not a value.

terminal i/o, eg stderr
	at least for output, no change needed:
	print | "cat -u 1>&2"
	can only have one of these active at one time.

ARGC and ARGV[] exist, essentially as in C.
	ARGC is the number of arguments including the program name.
	ARGV[0]..ARGV[ARGC-1] are the arguments
	These can be modified in any way at any time.
	If an ARGV[i] for i>0 is not null, it is assumed to be
	the name of a file and is opened in the normal sequence.
	New members of ARGV can be added dynamically beyond the
	ones currently processed.
	The argument '-' is added when input is stdin.


added system(), rand(), srand(), sin, cos, atan2

added variable FNR -- line number in current file
	can test FNR == 1 to see if in new file

Fixed so that \f, \b, \r, \ddd work in strings as in C

Functions are in:
	recursive
	arguments are call by value for scalars, by ref for arrays
	declaration is
		func f(arg list) statement
			arguments by name
	arguments are local;  all others global
	return [expr]

Order rules relaxed:
	BEGIN, END, func declarations can occur anywhere a pattern can.

Added awkcheck when syntax error encountered,
	for better identification of some errors.
	Other error messages better.  Line number in source
	and input line line both given for dynamic errors.
	Some previously uncaught things now flagged
	e.g.	print <= "foo"
		print > foo (where foo is null)
	detects calls of undefined functions, like foo(bar)
