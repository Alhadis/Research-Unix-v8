14 JAN 81:
	modified rhccomp.c so operators are output as += (for example)
	instead of =+ . Do a g/token=assignop/ to see the code changes.
	Then, had to fix the assignop checks.  do g/"[-+<>\*\/|&^%]= "/ to
	find all of the changes.
	Also, fixed the =+ (etc..) and initializaton violations in rhccomp.c.
28 OCT 80:
	Fixed bug in rhccomp.c which messed up goto labels.
	Is marked /*god*/
29 JUL 80:
	Changed all .asm files to .s
	Created makefile
29 APR 80:
	Running fpp on VAX:
		use malloc(sz) instead of alloc(sz); sz must be even !?
	fpp.c:		do not #define SMALL
	rhccomp.c:	HEADLEN: 4 -> 2*sizeof(int)
			own alloc() -- calls malloc()
			remove outcore.
	rhsymtab.c:	calloc() -> kalloc() which calls malloc()
			own OUT #define.
18 JAN 79:
	New rhfcc.c from RH: changes made to fpp.c --
	passes along cpp line numbers and uses;
	removed adding extra # line numbers and new abt(), warn(), pdiag() for messages.
	Also changes (and to cc.c) for -F[qunl] as 4th arg.
	New rhccomp.c.

06 JAN 79:
	fpp.c changed to accept "symtout" file
	as third command argument.  (cc.c -> /bin/cc changed also.)

08 DEC 78:
	This started with the tape sent to me by R. Hardin 6DEC78.
	Everything important has been saved on "source" disk.
	may remove the files in this directory.


07 DEC 78:

(7)  Making new /lib/fpp from new source from R. Hardin.
	Has alloc() calls in rhccomp.c and rhsymtab.c already fixed;
	  has "symtout" (instead of "a.out") in rhsymtab.c already;
	  therefore no changes needed to rhccomp.c or rhsymtab.c.
	Use my fpp.c to get /lib/fpp;
	  must set unixfmt = 1;
	  do or do not #define SMALL for 11/20 or not.
	Use new rhflib.asm which I gave him.
	Keep my rhfcc.c (although not using).

06 NOV 78:

(5)	Break up rhftoa.c into rhftoa1.c amd rhprintf.o;
	so can use libS.a printf.
	Also rhpfloat.o before rhftoa1.o in flibu "/lib/libfu.a"
	and rhprintf.o before rhpfloat.o
(6)	Also, remove fltpr.o in libS.a and
	remove global "pfloat" and "pscien" (leave) "pgen" from ffltpr.o

04 NOV 78:

(4)	Use "atof1()" from JP Hawkins at WH;
	mmatof.c -> mmatof.o.
	Put in "flibu" (-lfu).

19 OCT 78:

(1)	in rhccomp.c and rhsymtab.c;
		alloc error test no good on LSX
		on LSX error return is -1 and not 0.
		change: alloc -> malloc
(2)	fpp.c: rhfcc.c for LSX
	If SMALL DEFINEd (for 16k usr space):
		SYMTABSZ: 4096 -> 1024
		N:	200 -> 100
		OB:	200 -> 100
	Also make into a filter for new "cc -F" command.
	 Add output file as another command arg.
	 Remove "system4" calls to 'cc' command
	 and logic of options
(3)	in rhsymtab.c
		"a.out" -> symtout
	and symtout set in rhfcc.c (fpp.c)
