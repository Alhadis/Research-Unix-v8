a.out.h:
	Header structure: ints -> unsigned short
nm.c:
	added static char *progname = argv[0], made error messages
	printf(stderr, "%s: ....", progname, ....);  This is because
	PDP11-on-VAX system will call it 11nm.  All the other programs
	below do this, too.
	Added #ifndef A_DOT_OUT lines to default, as always, to "a.out",
	but now this is tweakable by the PDP11-on-VAX package. Same is true
	for all other programs which use a.out as a file name.
ar.c:
	Added char *progname = argv[0] for error messages.  On PDP11-on-VAX,
	without standard character archiver, ar will be called "car",
	character archiver.
arcv.c:
	same as ar.c above.  Also, sections have #ifdef vax lines which will
	fix the reverse longs and use manifest constants instead of sizeof's
	in the old binary pdp11-format archive.
ld.c:
	Slightly overkilled by globally changing all ints into shorts.
	char *progname = argv[0]; is used, and added to error messages.
	A_DOT_OUT is #defined as "a.out", is tweakable.
	One problem overcome was the search path for libraries.  Previously,
	a manifest constant string "/usr/lib/libxxxxx..." was used for the
	prefix path name;  an fopen was done on this string+4 ("/lib...")
	then on string+0 ("/usr/lib...").  This was changed to select
	colon-separated names such as the shell PATH variable in a
	#define LIBPATH "/lib:/usr/lib"
	The reason for this was that the string+4 convention was difficult
	to get around portably;  now the PDP11-on-VAX package can tweak this.
	It is NOT taken from the environment (by design decision) but can
	be replaced by a command option -Lstring, where string specifies
	the complete path.
	There is also a #define LIBPREFIX "/lib" in there which is
	tweakable by the VAX package, which would want "/11lib"
	there.  Lib files for the 11 on the vax are prefixed by "11".
	The lib file name when selected by the -l option is constructed as:
	    {an element of LIBPATH} + LIBPREFIX + {-l arg} + ".a"
ranlib.c:
	ranlib needs to know what the name of the archiver is.  If your
	standard system archiver is not char-type (such as USG machines)
	then the archiver is called "car"; else the default is "ar".
	ranlib also stores progname for error messages.
as:
	Uses two #define's: A_DOT_OUT "a.out" and PASS2PGM "/lib/as2".
	These need to be changed by the PDP11-on-VAX package, but are
	the standard as defaults if left alone.
c:
	No changes by S. Hartwell.  Makefile added.
crt:
	No changes.  Copied from research; the lmul and ldiv routines
	distributed in V7 were buggy.  Note: also includes csav.s
