These are files needed to producing a VMS C compiler.

The program filter translates unix assembly language into something
that the VMS assembler will accept assuming the file jeql.mar is
transported to VMS and made into a macro library to reside in
"db0:[c]jeql.mlb".

PLEASE NOTE THAT the most recent mit version of stdio.h for VMS has
been revised, due to alignment problems. (The code produced by the
compilers is not wholly compatible since that of the unix/32V compiler
attempts to allign longword members of structures on longword
boundaries and the mit/Ritchie compiler only aligns to 2 byte
boundaries.)  The revised stdio.h is given here.
