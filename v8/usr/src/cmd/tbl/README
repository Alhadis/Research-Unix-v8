This directory contains the 'tbl' table-formatting
program.  It is the standard reference
for the source code on both UNIX
and GCOS.

To compile tbl:
	make tbl
or (if you don't have make)
	cc t?.c -lS

To check:
  for all possible X
    tbl sampleX | troff -t >junk1
    a.out sampleX | troff -t >junk2
    cmp junk1 junk2
  if identical, the new version has all the features
  of the old program.  Most easily done by
  the 'compr' shell program or by

    sh scr >scrmess (nice nohup ...)


To install:
  cp a.out /usr/bin/tbl
