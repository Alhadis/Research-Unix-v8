Expletives are words that have no  content.   For  instance,
"it"  and  "there" are often used as expletives	in sentences
such as	"It is dark" and "There	are three solutions to	this
puzzle."  In  these  sentences,	 "it"  and  "there"  have no
content; they are simply linguistic placeholders.

     Expletives	 are  sometimes	 necessary,  e.g.,  "It	  is
raining."  Often,  however,  they add unnecessary words	to a
sentence: "There are three solutions  to  this	puzzle"	 can
easily be shortened to "This puzzle has	three solutions."

     To	find all the expletives	 counted  by  this  program,
