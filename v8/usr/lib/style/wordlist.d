     A LOT: ALOT: The correct spelling is always as two	 separate
     words.
%

     ACCEPT: EXCEPT: "Accept" is a verb	meaning	"to  receive,  to
     take."  "Except"  is either a verb	meaning	"to exclude" or	a
     preposition meaning "with the exclusion of, other than."
%

     ACTUAL: ACTUALLY: Do  not	use  "actually"	  as   a   simple
     intensifier (He actually had the nerve to strike me!).  Save
     it	for  expressing	 a  contrast  between  fact  and  opinion
     (George looks like	an old man, but	actually he is only 37).
%

     ADAPT: ADEPT: ADOPT: To  "adapt"  is  to  adjust,	to   make
     suitable.	 "Adept"  means	"skilled, proficient." To "adopt"
     is	to accept or to	take as	one's own.

	  The children _a_d_a_p_t_e_d their habits to	their  new  home.
	  She is _a_d_e_p_t at typing.  The resolution was _a_d_o_p_t_e_d.
%

     ADVICE: ADVISE: "Advice" is the  noun,  "advise"  the  verb.
     Similarly,	"device" is the	noun and "devise" the verb.
%

     AFFECT: EFFECT: "Affect" is normally only a  verb;	 "effect"
     is	 usually a noun, but it	is also	used as	a verb.	 The verb
     "affect" means either "influence" (This quiz will not affect
     your  final  grade)  or  "to pretend, assume" (He affected	a
     British accent).  The noun	effect means  "result"	(Painting
     the walls black had a depressing effect).	The verb "effect"
     means "to bring  about,  cause"  (The  election  effected	a
     change  of	 government).	The  noun  "affect"  is	 a rarely
     encountered  technical  term  in  psychology   meaning   "an
     emotion."
%

     ALL: ALL OF: Either is usually correct, but "of"  can  often
     be	 omitted  to  avoid  wordiness.	 Only "all of" is correct
     before personal pronouns (all of us,  all	of  them).   Only
     "all"  is	appropriate  before abstract nouns (All	beauty is
     deceptive).
%

     ALL READY: ALREADY: ALL TOGETHER: ALTOGETHER: "All	ready" is
     a	pronoun	plus an	adjective; "already" is	an adverb meaning
     "by a particular  time."  Similarly,  "all	 together"  is	a
     pronoun  plus  an adjective, and should be	used when meaning
     "at one time" or "in one place." "Altogether" is  an  adverb
     meaning "entirely"	or "in total."

	  They were _a_l_l	_r_e_a_d_y by noon.	It was _a_l_r_e_a_d_y noon.

	  The ten of us	were _a_l_l _t_o_g_e_t_h_e_r.  There were
	  _a_l_t_o_g_e_t_h_e_r too many.

%

     ALL RIGHT: ALRIGHT: The only  acceptable  spelling	 is  "all
     right."
%

     ALLUSION: DELUSION: ILLUSION: An  _a_l_l_u_s_i_o_n	 is  a	hint   or
     indirect reference	(to call an athlete a "Goliath"	is to use
     a Biblical	allusion).  An	_i_l_l_u_s_i_o_n  is  a	 deceptive  sense
     impression	 or  a	mistaken  belief.   When  an  _i_l_l_u_s_i_o_n is
     serious and persistent enough, it may become a _d_e_l_u_s_i_o_n.
%

     ALMOST: MOST: "Almost" is an adverb; "most" is a pronoun  or
     adjective.	  Colloquially,	"most" is often	used as	an adverb
     before a pronoun, but this	should be avoided in writing.

	  COLLOQUIAL   _M_o_s_t everybody likes chocolate.
	  STANDARD     _A_l_m_o_s_t everybody	likes chocolate.

%

     ALOUD: OUT LOUD: "Out  loud"  is  a  colloquial  variant  of
     "aloud" and should	be avoided in writing.
%

     ALTHOUGH: THOUGH: The words are interchangeable and both are
     correct.  The abbreviated forms "altho" and "tho" should not
     be	used in	formal writing.
%

     AMONG: BETWEEN: In	general, "among" refers	to more	than  two
     persons  or things, and "between" refers to only two persons
     or	things.	 "Between" is, however,	often used with	reference
     to	 more  than two	things if the things are being considered
     individually.  Only "between" is  correct	if  relationships
     are   being  considered  two  by  two:  there  were  several
     marriages _b_e_t_w_e_e_n members of the class.
%

     AND ETC.: "And"  is   redundant   because	 "etc."	  is   an
     abbreviation  for	Latin  "et  cetera," which means "and the
     rest." Hence saying "and etc." is like saying  "and  and  so
     on."
%

     ANY MORE: ANYMORE:	The correct spelling is	as  two	 separate
     words.   The  use	of  "any  more"	 in  a sentence	without	a
     negative is a regionalism and should be avoided in	writing.

	  REGIONAL     I see him almost	every day _a_n_y _m_o_r_e.
	  STANDARD     I see him almost	every day _n_o_w.

%

     ANY ONE: ANYONE: SOME ONE: SOMEONE: "Anyone" means	"anybody"
     or	"any person at all." "Any one" means "a	single individual
     and only one."

	  Choose _a_n_y_o_n_e	you like.
	  Choose _a_n_y _o_n_e of the	three.

     Exactly the  same	distinction  applies  to  "everyone"  and
     "every  one"; "everyone" means "all persons" and "every one"
     means "each single	individual." Similarly for "someone"  and
     "some one."
%

     ANY WAY: ANYWAY: ANYWAYS: "Any way" is an adjective  plus	a
     noun  meaning  "whatever way." "Anyway" is	an adverb meaning
     "in any case." "Anyways"  is  a  colloquial  substitute  for
     "anyway."

	  Do it	_a_n_y _w_a_y	you like, but do it _a_n_y_w_a_y.

%

     APT: LIABLE: LIKELY: PRONE: In careful usage,  all	 four  of
     these  words are distinguished.  "Apt" means "talented" (apt
     at	wood-working) or "suitable  for	 the  occasion"	 (an  apt
     remark).	 "Liable"   means   "susceptible   to	something
     unpleasant"  (liable  to  error)  or  "legally  responsible"
     (liable  for damages).  "Likely" means "probable" (likely to
     snow).  "Prone" refers to a strong	habit  or  predisposition
     (prone to temper tantrums).
%

     ASSURE: ENSURE: INSURE: "Assure" refers to	persons; "ensure"
     and  "insure"  to	events	or  things.   Each  verb  must be
     followed by an object.

	  _e_n_s_u_r_e his recovery,
	  _i_n_s_u_r_e his house and car,
	  _a_s_s_u_r_e him that he will recover.

     "Assure" means "to	give confidence	to or  to  make	 sure  or
     certain."

	  A successful field _a_s_s_u_r_e_d (us) a new	drying method.

     Although	 "ensure"    and    "insure"	are    considered
     interchangeable,  the  preference is to use "ensure" to mean
     "make sure	or  certain"  and  limit  "insure"  to	financial
     protection.

	  Certain inspection sequences have been established
	  to _e_n_s_u_r_e that the consoles will meet	all
	  customer requirements.

%

     AS TO: Do not use "as to" to mean "about."

	  INCORRECT   The clerk	inquired _a_s _t_o her health.
	  CORRECT     The clerk	inquired _a_b_o_u_t her health.

     "As to" is	redundant before the  subordinators  "who,  what,
     when, which, whether, where, why, and how."

	  WORDY	      The clerk	inquired _a_s _t_o _w_h_e_t_h_e_r she
		      was healthy.
	  IMPROVED    The clerk	inquired _w_h_e_t_h_e_r she was healthy.

%

     ATTENUATE: EXTENUATE: Both	  "attenuate"	and   "extenuate"
     basically mean "to	thin out." "Extenuate" is the legal term:
     "extenuating circumstances" make a	crime seem  less  serious
     or	contemptible than it originally	appeared.
%

     ATTRIBUTE: CONTRIBUTE: "Contribute"  means	 "to  give  one's
     share"  or	"to have a share" in something;	"attribute" means
     "to trace or ascribe something to a cause	or  source"  ("He
     attributed	 the  crossing	of the letters in the mail to the
     intervention of a supernatural power").
%

     AWFUL: AWFULLY: The adjective "awful" has	lost  its  former
     meaning  of  "inspiring  awe"  and	 has  come  to	have  the
     colloquial	meaning	of "unpleasant,	disagreeable." The adverb
     "awfully"	has  been  so  overused	 that today it means only
     "very." Both should be  avoided  in  writing.   The  use  of
     "awful"  as an adverb (I'm	awful sick of his complaining) is
     nonstandard.
%

     AWHILE: A WHILE: "A while"	may be used wherever "awhile" can
     be,  but  only  "a	 while"	 is correct after the preposition
     "for" or with "ago."

	  Wait _a_w_h_i_l_e. Rest _a_w_h_i_l_e before you start again.
	  Wait _a _w_h_i_l_e.	 We waited for _a _w_h_i_l_e.
	  He left _a _w_h_i_l_e ago.

%

     BARELY: HARDLY: SCARCELY: These are negative  words  and  no
     other negative should be used in the same clause.

	  INCORRECT   _h_a_r_d_l_y no	trouble, _b_a_r_e_l_y	didn't make,
		      without _h_a_r_d_l_y a word
	  CORRECT     _h_a_r_d_l_y any trouble, _b_a_r_e_l_y made, with
		      _h_a_r_d_l_y a word

     The same principle	applies	for  the  negative  time  adverbs
     "rarely"  and  "seldom."  Phrases	with "barely, hardly, and
     scarcely" are followed by "when" or "before" and not "than."

	  INCORRECT   She had scarcely left the	garage _t_h_a_n
		      her brakes failed.
	  CORRECT     She had scarcely left the	garage _w_h_e_n
		      her brakes failed.

%

     BECAUSE: "Because"	properly  introduces  noun  clauses,  not
     adverbial	clauses.   Thus,  after	 such  words as	"reason,"
     "excuse," and "explanation," the correct word is "that."

	  INCORRECT   The reason Judy is crying	is _b_e_c_a_u_s_e
		      she has a	toothache.
	  CORRECT     The reason Judy is crying	is _t_h_a_t
		      she has a	toothache.
	  INCORRECT   Her excuse for not coming	is _b_e_c_a_u_s_e
		      the roads	are bad.
	  CORRECT     Her excuse for not coming	is _t_h_a_t
		      the roads	are bad.

%

     BEING AS (HOW): BEING THAT: SEEING AS (HOW): Nonstandard for
     "because."
%

     BESIDE: BESIDES: "Beside" is a preposition	meaning	 "at  the
     side  of."	 "Besides"  is	either	a preposition meaning "in
     addition to" or an	adverb meaning "in addition, moreover."

	  _B_e_s_i_d_e the fishtank, was a pump.
	  _B_e_s_i_d_e_s the fishtank,	there was a birdcage.

%

     CAN: MAY: In speech, "can"	is widely used for both	 "ability
     to	 do"  and  "permission	to  do." In writing, use "may" to
     express the notion	of permission.
%

     CAPITAL: CAPITOL: "Capital" means "most important"	or  "most
     serious."	 "Capitol"   is	 a  building  in  which	 a  state
     legislature meets.
%

     CASE: CIRCUMSTANCES: INSTANCE: LINE: SITUATION: All of these
     words  tend to be overused, vague and are heavy contributors
     to	deadwood.

	  DEADWOOD   In	the _c_a_s_e of the	manufacture of paper,

%

     CENSOR: CENSURE: CENSER: To   "censor"   is   to	 examine,
     especially	  to   examine	 printed   matter   for	 possible
     objections.  To "censure" is to reprimand or to condemn.	A
     "censer" is a receptacle for incense, especially one used in
     religious ceremonies.

	  Half the story was _c_e_n_s_o_r_e_d.	The students condemned

	  carried the _c_e_n_s_e_r_s.

%

     CERTAIN: PARTICULAR: Redundant  in	 expressions  like  "this
     certain  person" or "in that certain instance." "Particular"
     is	preferable where "certain" could  be  ambiguous,  meaning
     either "some" or "reliable" (certain examples).
%

     CITE: SIGHT: SITE:	To "cite" is to	refer to.  "Sight"  means
     "view" or "spectacle." A "site" is	a location.

	  He _c_i_t_e_d an old legal	document.  The mountains
	  below	were a beautiful _s_i_g_h_t.	 We visited the
	  _s_i_t_e of the new building.

%

     COMMON: MUTUAL: Strictly  speaking,   "common"   refers   to
     something	shared	with  others  (a  common driveway, common
     interests).  "Mutual" means  "reciprocal,	having	the  same
     relation  to each other" (mutual respect, mutual agreement).
     The distinction is	often blurred in speech,  but  should  be
     preserved in writing.
%

     COMPARE TO: COMPARE WITH: Although	"to" and "with"	are  used
     interchangeably  in speech, in more formal	writing, "compare
     with" means "to examine in	order to note  similarities"  and
     "compare  to"  means "to represent	as similar, to liken." In
     other words, "compare with" is the	 act  of  comparing,  and
     "compare to" is the statement of similarity.
%

     COMPOSE: COMPRISE:	"Comprise" expresses the relation of  the
     larger  to	 the  smaller,	not  vice versa.  Try to think of
     "comprise"	as meaning "include."  "Compose" means	"to  form
     by	putting	together."

	  The U.S. _c_o_m_p_r_i_s_e_s 50	states.
	  The committee	was _c_o_m_p_o_s_e_d of	three representatives.

%

     CONNOTE: DENOTE: "Connote"	 implies  a  suggestion	  whereas
     "denote" specifies	a meaning.

		     His paper _c_o_n_n_o_t_e_s	that our research is
		     too conservative.
		     Signs in red _d_e_n_o_t_e danger.

%

     CONSCIENCE: CONSCIOUS: "Conscience" is a noun referring to	a
     sense  of	rightness.   "Conscious"  is an	adjective meaning
     "awake" or	"aware"	or "active mentally."

	  Let your _c_o_n_s_c_i_e_n_c_e be your guide.
	  I was	not _c_o_n_s_c_i_o_u_s of his fear.

%

     CONSENSUS OF OPINION: Redundant because the word "consensus"
     means "agreement of opinion." "Consensus" alone is	enough.
%

     CONTACT: Overworked  as  a	 verb  synonym	for  "talk  with,
     telephone,	 ask about, advise, inform, query, write to, call
     upon."
%

     CONTINUAL: CONTINUOUS: To be  "continuous,"  something  must
     extend without interruption in space or in	time.  People may
     keep up a "continual" conversation, interrupted because they
     have to pause for breath.
%

     CONVINCE: PERSUADE: You "convince"	someone	that something is
     right,  but  you "persuade" someone to do something.  Hence,
     you might convince	your instructor	that your  grade  is  too
     low, but still not	persuade him to	change it.
%

     COUNCIL: COUNSEL: CONSUL: "Council" means	"advisory  board"
     or	 "group." "Counsel" means "advice" or, especially in law,
     "the man who gives	advice."  It may also be used as a  verb.
     A "consul"	is a government	official.
%

     CREDIBLE: CREDULOUS: CREDITABLE: Stories  may  be	 _c_r_e_d_i_b_l_e
     (believable)  or  _i_n_c_r_e_d_i_b_l_e  (unbelievable); the people who
     read  them	 may  be  _c_r_e_d_u_l_o_u_s  (willing  to   believe)   or
     _i_n_c_r_e_d_u_l_o_u_s (skeptical).  An act that does	someone	credit is
     a _c_r_e_d_i_t_a_b_l_e (worthy of praise) act.
%

     DATA: DATUM: The	singular   "datum"   is	  seldom    used.
     Generally,	 "data"	 takes	a  plural  verb;  however, if the
     reference is to a group of	facts taken as a unit, a singular
     verb may be used.
%

     DES'ERT: DESERT': DESSERT': "Des'ert" means a wilderness  or
     dry,   sandy   region   with   sparse,  scrubby  vegetation.
     "Desert'" means to	abandon.  "Dessert'" (note the change  in
     spelling) is a sweet, such	as cake	or pie,	served at the end
     of	a meal.

	  The Mojave _D_e_s_e_r_t is part of the Great American _D_e_s_e_r_t

	    gas	station.
	  John and Sue baked a strawberry pie for _d_e_s_s_e_r_t.

%

     DEVICE: DEVISE: "Device" is a noun	and "devise" is	a verb.

	  His time machine was an amazing _d_e_v_i_c_e.
	  I wonder how he could	_d_e_v_i_s_e such a thing.

%

     DIFFER  FROM: DIFFER  WITH: "Differ  from"	 means	 "to   be
     different from, to	be unlike something." "Differ with" means
     "to disagree with someone."
%

     DISINTERESTED: UNINTERESTED: Although both	words  are  often
     used to mean "not interested," "disinterested" more properly
     is	 reserved   for	  the	meaning	  "impartial,	unbiased,
     objective."  "Uninterested" is used to mean "not interested,
     indifferent."
%

     DUE TO: DUE TO THE FACT THAT: "Due	to" is always  acceptable
     in	 an  adjectival	 phrase	(following directly a form of "to
     be":  the error was due to	 a  misunderstanding).	 However,
     some  still  object  to  using  "due  to"	to  introduce  an
     adverbial phrase (He was fired  due  to  his  incompetence).
     "Due to the fact that" is unnecessarily wordy and can always
     be	replaced by "because."
%

     EACH AND EVERY: "Each and	every"	is  unnecessarily  wordy;
     either  "each" or "every" is preferable.  If you do feel you
     must have both for	emphasis, the verb is still singular.
%

     EACH OTHER: ONE ANOTHER: Some extremely careful writers  use
     "each  other"  to	refer  to  two persons or things and "one
     another" for more	than  two.   For  most	people,	 the  two
     phrases are interchangeable.
%

     E.G.: I.E.: "E.g."	means  "for  example"  and  "i.e."  means
     "that is."	Both are usually abbreviated in	writing.
%

     ELECTRIC: ELECTRICAL: "Electric"  carries	 the   sense   of
     producing,	 arising  from,	or being actuated by electricity,
     e.g., electric pumps, electric motors, or electric	circuits.
     "Electrical"  implies  pertaining	to,  being related to, or
     associated	with electricity but without  its  properties  or
     characteristics,	e.g.,	electrical  industry,  electrical
     units.
%

     ENTHUSE: ENTHUSED:	Although  these	 words	are  widely  used
     colloquially,  many people	object to seeing them in writing.
     Use "be enthusiastic" and "enthusiastic" instead.
%

     ETC.: The abbreviation "etc." is acceptable, even in  formal
     writing,  to  avoid a long	and tedious list that the readers
     can infer for themselves.	However,  "etc."  should  not  be
     used  just	 because  the  writer  cannot  think of	any other
     examples;	rather	than  write:	"Vermin	  include   rats,
     cockroaches, etc.," try:  "Vermin include such pests as rats
     and cockroaches." Do not misspell "etc." as "ect."	  Do  not
     write "and	etc." See, AND ETC.
%

     EVER SO OFTEN: EVERY SO OFTEN: The	two do not mean	the  same
     thing.  "Ever so often" is	a somewhat childish way	of saying
     "very often, frequently." "Every so often"	 means	"now  and
     then, occasionally."
%

     EVERY ONE: EVERYONE: EVERYBODY: "Every  one"  is  used  when
     referring	to individual units in a larger	group.	"Everyone
     may seem to be plural, but	it requires a singular verb and	a
     singular	pronoun.   "Everybody"	is  interchangeable  with
     "everyone."

%

     EXACT: EXACTLY: "Exact" is	an adjective; do not  use  it  to
     modify  the  adjective  "same." The correct form is "exactly
     the same."

	  INCORRECT   He did the _e_x_a_c_t same thing.
	  CORRECT     He did _e_x_a_c_t_l_y the same thing.

%

     EXCEPT: UNLESS: "Except" is a preposition and should not  be
     used  to introduce	a clause.  To introduce	a clause, use the
     conjunction "unless."

	  INCORRECT   He never writes us _e_x_c_e_p_t	he wants money.
	  CORRECT     He never writes us _u_n_l_e_s_s	he wants money.

%

     EXPECT: Colloquial	or  regional  in  the  meaning	"suppose,
     suspect,	think."	 "Expect"  is  standard	 in  the  meaning
     "anticipate."

	  COLLOQUIAL   I _e_x_p_e_c_t	you already know him.
	  STANDARD     I _e_x_p_e_c_t	you to respond immediately.

%

     FARTHER: FURTHER: In practice,  the  two  words  are  almost
     interchangeable.	However, some prefer to	reserve	"farther"
     to	refer  to  physical  distance  (ten  miles  farther)  and
     "further"	for  other kinds of distance or	degree (a further
     observation).  Only "further" is correct in the meaning  "in
     addition, moreover, furthermore."
%

     FEWER: LESS: In speech, "less" is	often  used  before  both
     plural  and  mass	nouns.	 In  writing,  "less"  should  be
     reserved for mass nouns (less control) and	"fewer"	should be
     used  with	 plural	 nouns (fewer horses).	In general if the
     following noun ends in "s", use "fewer."
%

     FINALIZE: Although	"finalize" is  formed  according  to  the
     same  principles as the acceptable	"popularize," "legalize,"
     and "modernize,"  many  people  still  object  to	it.   Try
     "complete," "conclude," or	"put into final	form" instead.
%

     FIND: LOCATE: "Find" is a verb usually meaning "to	come upon
     by	 study,	 search	 or experiment." "Locate" can mean either
     "to determine the position	of something" or "to set up in	a
     particular	place."

%

     FORMALLY: FORMERLY: "Formally"  means  "in	 a  formal  way."
     "Formerly"	means "earlier,	in the past."
%

     FORTUITOUS: FORTUNATE: "Fortuitous" changes are  accidental,
     unplanned developments that are not always	"fortunate."
%

     FULL: FULSOME: "Fulsome," except when used	by people who are
     confused  by  its similarity with "full," means "offensive,"
     or	"disgusting." "Fulsome praise" is offensively exaggerated
     or	insincere.
%

     GOOD AND: As an intensifier meaning "very,"  "good	 and"  is
     colloquial; it should be avoided in writing.

	  COLLOQUIAL   Cleaning	the cellar made	him _g_o_o_d _a_n_d

%

     GRATITUDE: GRATUITOUS: "Gratitude"	is a noun meaning "to  be
     grateful or thankful."  "Gratuitous" is an	adjective meaning
     "costing nothing, free, uncalled for."

		     His _g_r_a_t_i_t_u_d_e made	all my efforts seem
		     worthwhile.
		     She gave him _g_r_a_t_u_i_t_o_u_s advice.

%

     HEALTHFUL: HEALTHY: A distinction	gradually  breaking  down
     restricts	"healthful"  to	 mean  "conducive  to health" and
     "healthy" to mean "possessing health."
%

     HOPEFULLY:	"Hopefully" is always acceptable in  the  meaning
     of	 "in  a	 hopeful manner" (Minnie asked hopefully if there
     were any brownies left).  As a sentence modifier meaning "it
     is	 to  be	 hoped,"  "hopefully"  is  attacked  by	many, who
     apparently	have not noticed that "hopefully"  is  completely
     parallel	to   such   acceptable	 sentence   modifiers  as
     "undoubtedly" and "preferably." To	be absolutely  safe,  you
     can reserve "hopefully" for the first meaning.
%

     HUMAN: HUMANE: Not	every human being is  "humane"--that  is,
     kind, compassionate, sensitive, or	refined.
%

     I: ME: The	objective case of "I" is  "me."	 "Me"  can  be	a
     direct   object,	an   indirect  object,	an  object  of	a
     preposition, an object of a verbal, or  the  subject  of  an
     infinitive.

	  It was a pleasure for	the engineer and _m_e to
	  review the book.

	  This is a decision that must be made between
	  you and _m_e [not I].

%

     IDENTICAL TO: IDENTICAL WITH: Authorities	disagree  on  use
     and  acceptability;  use  the  preposition	 that  feels more
     comfortable.    "Identical	  with"	  means	  uniform   with;
     "identical	to" means "equal to" or	the "same as."
%

     IF: WHETHER: "If" and "whether" are  almost  interchangeable
     after  a  verb  and before	a clause.  "Whether" is	preferred
     when an alternative is expressed (Tell me whether	you  want
     to	play Probe or Scrabble).
%

     IMPLY: INFER: "Imply" means "to hint or suggest  indirectly,
     without   stating	 directly."  "Infer"  means  "to  make	a
     conclusion, based on evidence." You might	infer  that  your
     roommate  is  angry  because  he  implied it by throwing his
     track shoes at you.
%

     IN BACK OF: IN BEHIND: IN FRONT OF: BEFORE: The   "in"    is
     unnecessary  in  "in  back	of" and	"in behind." "Back of" is
     acceptable, though	somewhat more colloquial  than	"behind."
     "In  front	 of" is	always correct and often clearer and less
     awkward than the formal "before."
%

     INGENIOUS: INGENUOUS: "Ingenious" means  "having  or  giving
     evidence  of  resourceful	intelligence."	It can be used of
     either persons  (an  ingenious  strategist)  or  things  (an
     ingenious device).	 "Ingenuous" means "naively frank." It is
     used only of persons and of things	closely	 associated  with
     them (an ingenuous	proposal).
%

     IN LIEU OF: "In lieu of" means "instead of" or "in	the place
     of." If does not mean "in view of." Even used correctly, the
     expression	is somewhat of an affectation and usually  should
     be	avoided.
%

     IN REGARDS TO: Nonstandard	for "in	regard to." "As	 regards"
     is	 correct,  but	sounds affected	in American English.  All
     expressions with regard  are  wordy  and  often  are  better
     replaced with "about" or "concerning."
%

     INSIDE OF: OUTSIDE OF: As prepositions referring  to  space,
     the  "of"	is  redundant  (Don't  wash the	dog inside of the
     house).  In time expressions, "inside of" is colloquial  for
     "within" (You'll hear inside of a week).  As nouns, "inside"
     and "outside" require the preposition "of"	(We couldn't  see
     the outside of the	house because it was too dark).
%

     IRREGARDLESS: DISREGARDLESS: Both	 are   nonstandard    for
     "regardless."
%

     ITS: IT'S: ITS': "Its" is a possessive  adjective	(the  dog
     ate  its  food); "it's is the contraction for "it is" or "it
     has" (It's	lost its flavor).  "Its'" is always incorrect.
%

     JUDICIAL: JUDICIOUS: A "judicial"	decision  is  a	 decision
     reached  by  a  judge or by a court.  A "judicious" decision
     shows  sound  judgment.   Not  every  judicial  decision  is
     judicious.
%

     KIND: SORT: TYPE: These words are	singular  and  should  be
     modified  by "this" or "that," not	by "these" or "those." In
     the phrase:  "this	kind (sort,  type)  of	a,"  the  "a"  is
     redundant and should be omitted.
%

     KIND OF: SORT OF: Colloquial  for	"somewhat,  rather,"   in
     sentences like (He's kind of big for his age).
%

     LATER: LATTER: "Later" is an adjective  meaning  "coming  or
     remaining	after  the  proper  time" (He came later than the
     rest.)  "Latter" is also an adjective, but	 means	"relating
     to, or being the second of	two groups or things referred to"
     (Of apples	and oranges, I prefer the latter).
%

     LEAD: LED:	The correct past tense and past	participle of the
     verb "lead" is "led," not "lead."
%

     LIE: LAY: LAID: LAIN: Three pairs of similar verbs	have been
     so	thoroughly confused in dialect and nonstandard usage, and
     even in literate conversation, that many people have trouble
     distinguishing   between	them  in  meaning  and	spelling,
     particularly in their uses	 with  separable  suffixes.   See
     also rise-raise and sit-set.
	  _L_i_e (lay, lain), intransitive, but usually modified  or
     combined with a suffix like down, indicates that the subject
     occupies a	position.

	  The book _l_i_e_s	on the table.
	  The book _l_a_y on the table yesterday.
	  The book has _l_a_i_n on the table in the	past.

	  "Lay"	(laid, laid), transitive except	for a few special
     uses  ("The  hens lay well"; "Lay on, Macduff"), means place
     or	put and	now  appears  mainly  in  a  variety  of  special
     contexts (see a dictionary).

	  He _l_a_y_s brick	in his spare time.
	  The men _l_a_i_d their plans carefully.
	  the soldiers _h_a_v_e _l_a_i_d down their arms.

%

     LIKE: Careful writers still use "like" as a preposition  and
     "as"  or  "as  if"	 as a conjunction to connect two complete
     clauses.  However,	if a verb has been  omitted  by	 ellipsis
     from the second clause, "like" is an acceptable connector.

	  COLLOQUIAL   He looked _l_i_k_e he had just had a	shock.

	  ACCEPTABLE   He looked _l_i_k_e a	man in shock.

%

     LITERAL: LITERALLY: VERITABLE: "Literally"	  means	  "in	a
     strict  sense,  exactly as	spoken or written" and should not
     be	used as	an intensifier meaning	"almost."  "He	literally
     crucified her" means that he actually nailed her to a cross.
	  Similarly, "veritable" means "true, actual," and should
     not  be  used  as	a  simple  intensifier.	  "My nephew is	a
     veritable monkey" makes you a monkey's uncle.
%

     LOOSE: LOOSEN: LOSE: "Loose" is either an adjective  meaning
     "free,  unattached"  or a verb meaning "set free, unfasten."
     The verb "loosen" means the same as the verb "loose." "Lose"
     is	a verb meaning "mislay,	suffer loss."

	  You will _l_o_s_e	an arm if that dog gets	_l_o_o_s_e.

%

     LOTS OF: A LOT OF:	Colloquial for "a great	deal,  many"  and
     best avoided in writing.
%

     LUXURIANT: LUXURIOUS: A "luxurious" house may be  surrounded
     by	"luxuriant"--that is, profusely	growing--vegetation.
%

     MAJORITY: PLURALITY: Save	"majority"  for	 use  with  exact
     counts,  where  a	contrast  between  the	majority  and the
     minority is made or implied.   "Majority"	should	never  be
     used with mass nouns.

	  INACCURATE The _m_a_j_o_r_i_t_y of the apples	are bruised.

     "Plurality" is a technical	term; it  means	 "the  difference
     between   the  number  of	votes  received	 by  the  winning
     candidate	and  the  votes	 received  by  the  next  highest
     candidate."
%

     MARSHAL: MARSHALL:	In the United States, this word	ends with
     a	double	"l"  only  when	it serves as the proper	name of	a
     person or place.	In  other  instances,  it  is  "marshal,"
     whether  it  be  "field  'marshal'"  or  "to 'marshal' one's
     forces."
%

     MATERIAL: MATERIEL: "Material" is a very general term  which
     can be used for any matter	or substance from which	something
     is	made.	"Materiel"  refers  to	apparatus  or  equipment,
     especially	military supplies.
%

     MASTERFUL: MASTERLY: "Masterful"  is  an  adjective  meaning
     "unusually	 competent to play the master."	 It also can mean
     "a	 strong,  virile  personality	and   ability	to   deal
     authoritatively   with  affairs."	 "Masterly"  is	 also  an
     adjective	meaning	 "to  indicate	thorough   knowledge   or
     superior skill and	power."
%

     MAY BE: MAYBE: "May  be"  is  a   verb   phrase   indicating
     possibility.    "Maybe"  is  an  adverb  meaning  "perhaps."
     "Maybe" is	 somewhat  colloquial;	in  formal  writing,  use
     "perhaps" instead.

     MORAL: MORALE: "Moral"  is	 a   modifier,	 concerning   the
     preference	  of   right  over  wrong;  "morale"  is  a  noun
     suggesting	good spirits and a healthy attitude.

	  George Washington was	a _m_o_r_a_l	man.
	  The victory improved the soldiers' _m_o_r_a_l_e.

%

     NICE: Colloquial as a synonym  for	 "affable,"  "agreeable,"
     "amiable,"	"congenial," "considerate," and	so on through the
     alphabet.	Use a more exact word.	 Carefully  used,  "nice"
     means "precise," "exact," "discriminating."
%

     NONE: When	"none" means not one  or  no  part  (of),  it  is
     singular; when it means not any, it is plural.

	  _N_o_n_e [not one] was satisfactory.
	  _N_o_n_e [not any] of the	receivers were impaired.

%

     NON SEQUITUR: The English translation of the Latin	phrase is
     "it  does	not follow."  Within a sentence, a "non	sequitur"
     is	a fact or statement which has  absolutely  no  connection
     with the main sense of the	sentence.  It is usually a forced
     effort to include a bit of	irrelevant information,	as  "Born
     in	Ohio, she loved	cats."

     Another kind of "non sequitur" is a comment or answer  to	a
     query  which  bears no relation to	the query to which it was
     supposed  to  be  a  response.   This  is	 sometimes   done
     deliberately to evade the question	or to create confusion.
%

     NOR: "Nor"	is correctly used as (1) the second member of the
     correlative conjunction "neither...nor," or (2) to	introduce
     a main clause after a preceding negative main clause.  After
     a preceding "not, no, never, etc.," in the	same clause, only
     "or" is correct.

	  INCORRECT   The refugees have	no warm	clothing _n_o_r
		      shelter.
	  CORRECT     The refugees have	no warm	clothing _o_r

		      do they have shelter.
	  CORRECT     He was neither a gentleman _n_o_r a farmer.

%

     NUMBER: AMOUNT: "Number" refers  to  objects  which  can  be
     counted.  "Amount"	refers to quantity in bulk.

	  The present method of	refining this metal requires an
	  excessive _n_u_m_b_e_r of work hours.

	  The present method of	refining this metal requires an
	  excessive _a_m_o_u_n_t of employee time.

%

     OFF OF: The "of" is unnecessary.  The use of "off"	 or  "off
     of"  to  designate	source or origin is nonstandard	(I bought
     it	off of a friend	of mine).  Use "from" instead.
%

     ON ACCOUNT OF: Colloquial for "because of." The use  of  "on
     account  of" instead of "because" to introduce a noun clause
     is	nonstandard.

	  NONSTANDARD	I stopped reading _o_n _a_c_c_o_u_n_t _o_f	the
			light was so bad.
	  STANDARD	I stopped reading _b_e_c_a_u_s_e the light

%

     ONE OF THE: THE ONLY ONE OF THE: "One of the" is followed by
     a	plural	verb;  "the  only  one	of  the" is followed by	a
     singular verb.

	  Norman is _o_n_e	_o_f _t_h_e men who own their own boats.

     ONTO: ON TO: "Onto"  means	 to  position  on;  "on	 to,"  to
     progress to the next item or step.
%

     OVER WITH:	Colloquial for "ended" or simply "over."
%

     PASSED: PAST: "Passed" is the past	tense and past participle
     of	 the  verb  "to	 pass."	 "Past"	 is a noun, adjective, or
     preposition.

	  The time has _p_a_s_s_e_d rapidly.
	  In the _p_a_s_t; _p_a_s_t events; _p_a_s_t our window

%

     PEOPLE: PERSONS: As a general rule, use "people" with  large
     numbers, "persons"	with exact or small numbers.  _P_e_r_s_o_n_s are
     the individuals who make up the _p_e_o_p_l_e.
%

     PERCENT: PERCENTAGE: Use "percent"	only after  numbers;  use
     "percentage"   as	 a  part  or  proportion  of  the  whole.
     "Percent,"	originally two words from the Latin "per centum,"
     has   become   one	  word	 (see  Webster's  New  Collegiate
     Dictionary, 8th edition).

	  Only 5 _p_e_r_c_e_n_t of the	units failed, but this

%

     PERSONAL: "Personal" is usually redundant and  best  omitted
     after  possessive	adjectives or nouns.  For example, in the

     phrase:   "My  personal  feelings,"  what	else  could  your
     feelings be except	personal?  Reserve "personal" to contrast
     with impersonal (highly personal remarks).
%

     PLAN ON: PLAN TO: "Plan on" is a colloquial  substitute  for
     "plan to,"	perhaps	by confusion with "count on." In writing,
     use "plan to."
%

     PRACTICABLE: PRACTICAL: A "practicable" plan  seems  capable
     of	 being	put  into practice.  A "practical" plan, when put
     into practice, is workable	 or  effective.	  Unlike  things,
     people can	be practical but not practicable.

		"Your plan for introducing low-cost synthetic
		fuels to the public sounds _p_r_a_c_t_i_c_a_l, but

%

     PRINCIPAL: PRINCIPLE: "Principal" is  an  adjective  meaning
     "chief,  main" or a noun meaning (1) "the head of a school,"
     or	(2) "money used	as  capital,  as  opposed  to  interest."
     "Principle"  is a noun meaning "rule, law,	doctrine." It may
     help to remember that the adjective is always "principal."
%

     PRONE: SUPINE: It is impossible for a man to "lie 'prone' on
     his back."	"Prone"	means "face downward."	If he is lying on
     his back, he is "supine."
%

     PROVED: PROVEN: "Proved" is the only form having  historical
     foundation,  but  "proven"	 is  also commonly accepted.  The
     verb "prove" is often used	carelessly of statements that are
     not proved; often "suggest," "imply," or "indicate" would be
     more accurate.
%

     PROVIDED: PROVIDED THAT: PROVIDING: All  are  acceptable  in
     the  meaning  "on	the  condition	that,"	but "provided" is
     preferred in more formal writing.	The "that" can be omitted
     unless  confusion	would result.  None of these need be used
     where "if"	will express the same meaning.
%

     RARELY EVER: SELDOM EVER: SELDOM OR EVER: Instead of "rarely
     ever,"  use "rarely" or "rarely if	ever." Instead of "seldom
     ever" or "seldom or  ever,"  use  "seldom,"  "hardly  ever,"
     "seldom if	ever," or "seldom or never."
%

     REAL: REALLY: "Real" is colloquial	as  an	adverb	(She  was
     real pleased).  Use "really" or "very" instead.  Or consider
     omitting the adverb entirely; "really" often  sounds  as  if
     the  writer  is  trying too hard to convince the reader (You
     _r_e_a_l_l_y must try this new shampoo).
%

     RESPECTFULLY: RESPECTIVELY: "Respectfully"	 means	"full  of
     respect"; "respectively" means "with respect or reference to
     each of several things in	the  order  in	which  they  were
     mentioned"	  ("'Un'   and	 'deux'	 mean  'one'  and  'two,'
     respectively").
%

     RISE: RAISE: The two verbs	are frequently confused.   "Rise"
     (rose,  risen),  intransitive,  often combined with suffixes
     like "up,"	indicates that the subject moves.

	  He _r_i_s_e_s before dawn.
	  He _r_o_s_e before dawn yesterday.
	  He has never _r_i_s_e_n before dawn in his	life.

     "Raise" (raised,  raised),	 usually  transitive  (but  "John
     opened  the  betting,  and	 Tom raised"), indicates that the
     subject acts on something,	making it rise or appear.

	  He _r_a_i_s_e_s his	hand when he wants to talk.
	  The committee	_r_a_i_s_e_d a new issue.
	  His salary has not been _r_a_i_s_e_d for a year.

%

     SELF: The	only correct forms of the  pronouns  are  myself,
     yourself,	himself,  herself,  itself,  oneself,  ourselves,
     yourselves, and themselves.

     Although "-self" forms are	often used  in	speech	when  the
     subject  of  the sentence is not the same as the receiver of
     the action, this usage should be avoided in writing, and  "-
     self"  forms  should  be used only	as intensive or	reflexive
     pronouns.

	  COLLOQUIAL   He told a funny story to	Paul and myself.
	  PREFERABLE   He told a funny story to	Paul and me.

%

     SHALL: WILL: In American English, "will" is by far	the  more
     common,   except  in  legal  documents  and  in  asking  for
     direction or suggestions in the first person (Shall we bring
     in	 the  deck chairs?).  If "will"	seems natural to you, use
     it; "shall" would probably	sound affected	to  your  readers
     too.
%

     SIT: SET: The two	verbs  are  frequently	confused.   "Sit"
     (sat,  sat),  intransitive	except for a few uses, especially
     with suffixes like	"out" or "with"	("She sat out the  dance;
     she  sits	a  horse gracefully"), indicates that the subject
     occupies a	place or seat or is in a sitting position.

	  He _s_i_t_s by the window.  He _s_a_t by the	window last week.
	  He has _s_a_t there for a year.

     "Set" (set, set), transitive except for a few uses	("The sun
     sets  in  the  west;  the hens are	setting"), means place or
     put, often	varied in combinations	with  words  like  "off,"
     "up," and "by."

	  He _s_e_t the lamp on the table.
	  They _s_e_t up the new organization yesterday.
	  Finally they have _s_e_t	out on their journey.

%

     SO: TOO: VERY: "So" and "too" are colloquial substitutes for
     "very" in negative	clauses	and should be avoided in writing.
     Either use	"very" or omit the intensifier entirely.

	  COLLOQUIAL   The eggplant quiche doesn't taste _s_o good.
	  COLLOQUIAL   The eggplant quiche doesn't taste _t_o_o good.
	  STANDARD     The eggplant quiche doesn't taste _v_e_r_y good.

%

     SOME TIME: SOMETIME: SOMETIMES: "Some  time"  refers  to	a
     period   or  span	of  time  (I  saw  her	some  time  ago).
     "Sometime"	refers to a particular but indefinite time in the
     future  (Come  to	see me sometime).  "Sometimes" means "now
     and  then,	 at  times"  (I	 see  her  sometimes,	but   not
     regularly).  "Sometime" is	also a slightly	archaic	adjective
     (A	sometime teacher, he now is a broker).
%

     SOMEBODY: SOMEONE:	"Somebody"  is	one  or	 some  person  of
     unspecified    or	 indefinite   identity.	   "Someone"   is
     interchangeable with "somebody."

	  _S_o_m_e_b_o_d_y outside would like to speak with you.
	  _S_o_m_e_o_n_e outside would	like to	speak with you.

     SOPHISTICATED: During the 1920's and 1930's  "sophisticated"
     was  used chiefly to describe people with a high quotient of
     worldly wisdom and	urbanity.   Since  World  War  II  a  new
     scientific	 application has evolved, and today one	speaks of
     highly "sophisticated" computers and "sophisticated" weapons
     systems,  when  describing	 devices  that are complicated in
     design and	advanced in form.  Both	senses of "sophisticated"
     are Standard English.
%

     SUBSTITUTE: It  is	 usually  incorrect  to	 use  any   other
     preposition  than "for" to	follow the word	"substitute."  It
     is	sometimes advisable to use the word "replace" rather than
     "substitute."
%

     STATIONARY: STATIONERY: "Stationary" is a	modifier  meaning
     "not  movable"  or	 "not  moving";	 "stationery"  is  a noun
     meaning "writing materials." They can  be	distinguished  by
     remembering that letters are written with stationery.
%

     SUIT: SUITE: "Suit," the commoner word, can be either a verb
     ("Suit   yourself")   or  a  noun	("a  tailor-made  suit").
     "Suite," only a noun, has several specialized uses.

	  The ambassador and his _s_u_i_t_e occupied	a _s_u_i_t_e	of rooms.

%

     TERRIBLE: TERRIBLY: Overused  and	misused;  colloquial   as
     general  intensives  ("She	is a terribly sweet girl") and as
     blanket words signifying anything unpleasant  ("I	had  been
     vaccinated	and felt terrible").
%

     TERRIFIC: Recently	misused	and overused as	a general synonym
     for   "large,"   "impressive,"   "dramatic,"  "significant,"
     "dexterous," or "important," it can now scarcely be used  in
     its standard meaning, "causing terror."
%

     THAN: THEN: "Than"	is a subordinating  conjunction	 used  in
     making  comparisons.   "Then"  is	an  adverb  of	time or	a
     conjunctive adverb	meaning	"consequently, therefore."
%

     THAT: WHICH: "That"  introduces  only  restrictive	 clauses.
     "Which"  may  introduce either restrictive	or nonrestrictive
     clauses, although some writers prefer to  use  "which"  only
     with nonrestrictive clauses.

	  RESTRIC.    The shells _t_h_a_t _s_h_e _s_e_l_l_s	_b_y _t_h_e
		      _s_e_a_s_h_o_r_e are overpriced.
	  CLAUSE      (The restrictive clause limits the
		      shells being discussed to	those sold by
		      the seashore.)

	  NONRESTRIC. The shells, _w_h_i_c_h	_s_h_e _s_e_l_l_s _b_y _t_h_e
		      _s_e_a_s_h_o_r_e,	are overpriced.
	  CLAUSE      (All the shells being discussed are over-
		      priced; the nonrestrictive clause	simply
		      gives additional information about the
		      shells.)

     If	the clause could contain "by the way," then  use  "which"
     with a comma before it.

	  The shells,  _w_h_i_c_h _b_y	_t_h_e _w_a_y	she sells by the seashore,

%

     THERE: THEIR: THEY'RE: "There" is an adverb or an	expletive
     pronoun; "their" is a possessive adjective; "they're" is the
     contraction of "they are."

	  _T_h_e_y'_r_e pitching _t_h_e_i_r tent over _t_h_e_r_e.

%

     THUSLY: THUS: Nonstandard for "thus." "Thus" is  already  an
     adverb and	needs no additional "ly."
%

     TILL: UNTIL: Either form is correct and the  two  words  are
     interchangeable.  The spelling 'til, however, is incorrect.
%

     TO: TOO: TWO: "To"	is a preposition and is	also used to form
     the  infinitive;  "too"  is  an  adverb;  "two is a cardinal
     number.

	  The _t_w_o girls	were _t_o_o small _t_o see over the fence.

%

     TOWARD: TOWARDS: Either form is correct,  although	 "toward"
     is	preferred in American usage.
%

     UNIQUE: In	careful	usage, "unique"	means "the only	one,  the
     sole  example,  having no equal." Hence you should	not write
     he	was a very unique child	(or  rather  unique  or	 somewhat
     unique)  any  more	 than  you would write he was a	very only
     child.  If	you mean simply	"unusual,"  then  write	 unusual,
     rare, remarkable, or extraordinary.
%

     VERY: QUITE: RATHER: "Very,"  "quite"   and   "rather"   are
     intensifiers  that	 are  generally	 overused and unnecessary
     (e.g. _v_e_r_y	dead, frozen _q_u_i_t_e to the bottom, _r_a_t_h_e_r like  an
     apple).   These  words should be used sparingly.  You should
     try to use	words that are strong themselves.
%

     VERY: VERY MUCH: Strictly	 speaking,   "very   much"    (or
     "greatly")	 should	 be  used  to modify past participles and
     "very" to modify adjectives.  The problem lies  in	 deciding
     whether  a	 past  participle  is  also an adjective.  If the
     participle	has a different	meaning	 from  the  verb,  it  is
     probably a	true adjective (determined, very determined), but
     in	many other instances, the line is not easy to draw.   One
     way   of	resolving   the	 difficulty  is	 to  omit  "very"
     completely; "very"	is overused as an intensifier and many	a
     sentence is improved by its removal.
%

     WAY: WAYS:	(1)  Use   "way"   for	 "distance,   "ways"   is
     colloquial.

	  COLLOQUIAL   That's a	long _w_a_y_s to go	by canoe.
	  STANDARD     That's a	long _w_a_y to go by canoe.

     (2) "Way" for "away" is colloquial.

	  COLLOQUIAL   Don't go	_w_a_y--I need you.
	  STANDARD     Don't go	_a_w_a_y--I	need you.

     (3) The phrases "in a bad way" meaning "in	 poor  condition"
     and "in the worst way" meaning "very much,	greatly" are both
     colloquial.
%

     WEATHER: WHETHER: "Weather" refers	to atmospheric conditions
     such  as  temperature  or	cloudiness.   "Whether"	 helps to
     express choice or an alternative.

	  Daily	_w_e_a_t_h_e_r	reports	are studied by meteorologists.
	  _W_h_e_t_h_e_r we call or write for reservations, we	must

%

     WHICH: WHO: THAT: "Which"	refers	to  nonhumans,	"who"  to
     persons, and "that" to either.  See also, THAT, WHICH.
%

     WHOSE: WHO'S: "Whose" is the possessive adjective or pronoun
     from  "who"  or  "which." "Who's" is the contraction of "who
     is" or "who has." Note that "whose" is perfectly  acceptable
     as	 a  possessive	for  a nonhuman	referent and often is far
     less awkward than "of which."

%

     WISE: The	 suffix	 -wise	is   completely	  acceptable   in
     established  words	 such  as  "clockwise,"	 "otherwise," and
     "lengthwise."   However,  its  use	 to  form   new	  adverbs
     indiscriminately is abhorred by many.  Even if "-wise" saves
     space, it is best to avoid	it.

	  QUESTIONABLE	The house was satisfactory location-wise.
	  PREFERABLE	The location of	the house was satisfactory.

%

     YOU: In writing, "you" should be reserved for addressing the
     reader  directly  and  should  be	avoided	 as an indefinite
     pronoun.  Hence, "you" is	correct	 in  imperatives  and  in
     giving  instructions or advice addressed specifically to the
     reader.  As an  indefinite	 pronoun,  use	"one,"	"anyone,"
     "everyone,"  "a  person,"	or  the	plural "people"	or "those
     (who)."

	  COLLOQUIAL   When you	are deaf, you are cut off from
