/*
 * The TCPT_REXMT timer is used to force retransmissions.
 * The TCP has the TCPT_REXMT timer set whenever segments
 * have been sent for which ACKs are expected but not yet
 * received.  If an ACK is received which advances tp->snd_una,
 * then the retransmit timer is cleared (if there are no more
 * outstanding segments) or reset to the base value (if there
 * are more ACKs expected).  Whenever the retransmit timer goes off,
 * we retransmit all unacknowledged segments, and do an exponential
 * backoff on the retransmit timer.
 *
 * The TCPT_PERSIST timer is used to keep window size information
 * flowing even if the window goes shut.  If all previous transmissions
 * have been acknowledged (so that there are no retransmissions in progress),
 * and the window is shut, then we start the TCPT_PERSIST timer, and at
 * intervals send a single byte into the peers window to force him to update
 * our window information.  We do this at most as often as TCPT_PERSMIN
 * time intervals, but no more frequently than the current estimate of
 * round-trip packet time.  The TCPT_PERSIST timer is cleared whenever
 * we receive a window update from the peer.
 *
 * The TCPT_KEEP timer is used to keep connections alive.  If an
 * connection is idle (no segments received) for TCPTV_KEEP amount of time,
 * but not yet established, then we drop the connection.  If the connection
 * is established, then we force the peer to send us a segment by sending:
 *	<SEQ=SND.UNA-1><ACK=RCV.NXT><CTL=ACK>
 * This segment is (deliberately) outside the window, and should elicit
 * an ack segment in response from the peer.  If, despite the TCPT_KEEP
 * initiated segments we cannot elicit a response from a peer in TCPT_MAXIDLE
 * amount of time, then we drop the connection.
