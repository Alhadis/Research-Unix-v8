To print the grap manual, you need to

	chmod +x trget *.awk
	eqn memo | troff -ms

Note the -ms!  Also note that grap is
called only indirectly, via suitably
clever and obscure macros in the file
"macros".  If things don't work, this
is the place to start looking.  (The
cleverness is necessary to successfully
include source files containing \'s.)
