.SH NAME
nlist \- get entries from name list
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <nlist.h>
.B nlist(filename, nl)
.B char *filename;
.B struct nlist nl[];
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Nlist
examines the name list in
the given executable output file
and selectively extracts a
list of values.
The name list consists of
an array of structures containing names,
types and values.
The list is terminated with a null name.
Each name is looked up in the name list of
the file.
If the name is found, the type and value of the
name are inserted in the next two fields.
If the name is not found, both entries are set to 0.
See
.IR a.out (5)
for the structure declaration.
.PP
This subroutine is useful for
examining the system name list kept in `/unix' .
In this way programs can obtain system addresses
that are up to date.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
a.out(5)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
All
type entries are set to 0 if the file cannot be found
or if it is not a valid namelist.
.SH BUGS
On other versions of UNIX you must include <a.out.h> rather than <nlist.h>.
This is unfortunate, but
<a.out.h>
can't be used on the
VAX because it contains a union,
which can't be initialized.
