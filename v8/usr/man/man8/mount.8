.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mount
announces to the system that a removable file system
is present on the device
.I special.
The file
.I name
must exist already; it
must be a directory (unless the root of the
mounted file system is not a directory).
It becomes the name of the newly mounted root.
The optional argument
.B \-r
indicates that the file system
is to be mounted read-only.
.PP
.I Umount
announces to the system that the removable file system previously
mounted on device
.I special
is to be removed.
.PP
If the
.B \-a
option is present for either
.I mount
or
.IR umount ,
an attempt is made to mount or dismount each of the file systems named in
.IR /etc/fstab .
The
.I special
file name from
.I /etc/fstab
is the block special name.
.PP
These commands
maintain a table of mounted devices in
.I /etc/mtab.
If invoked without an argument,
.I mount
prints the table.
.PP
Physically write-protected and magnetic tape file
systems must be mounted read-only
or errors will occur when access times are updated,
whether or not any explicit write is attempted.
.SH FILES
/etc/mtab	mount table

.SH BUGS
Mounting file systems full of garbage will crash the system.
.br
Mounting a root directory on a non-directory
makes some apparently good pathnames invalid.
.br
These commands deal only with filesystem type 0.
They should be made more general.
