.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pstat
interprets the contents of certain system tables.
If
.I file
is given, the tables are sought there, otherwise
in
.I /dev/kmem.
The required namelist is taken from
.IR namelist ,
default
.I /unix.

.TP \w'WCHAN\ 'u
.B \-a
Under
.BR \-p ,
describe all process slots rather than just active ones.

.IP 000008
swapped out
.IP 000010
traced
.IP 000020
used in tracing
.IP 000080

.IP 000100
prevented from swapping during
.IR fork (2)
.IP 000200
gathering pages for raw i/o
.IP 000400
exiting
.IP 008000
process is demand paging data pages from its text inode.
.IP 030000
process has warned of anomalous paging behavior with
.IR vlimit (2).
.IP 040000
process is in a sleep which will timeout.
.IP 080000
a parent of this process has exited and this process
is now considered detached.
.RE
.IP POIP
number of pages currently being pushed out from this process.
.IP PRI
Scheduling priority, see
.IR nice (2).
.IP SIGNAL
Signals received (signals 1-32 coded in bits 0-31),
.IP UID
Real user ID.
.IP SLP
Amount of time process has been blocked.
.IP TIM
Time resident in seconds; times over 127 coded as 127.
.IP CPU
Weighted integral of CPU time, for scheduler.
.IP NI
Nice level,
see
.IR nice (2).
.IP PGRP
Process number of root of process group
(the opener of the controlling terminal).
.IP PID
The process ID number.
.IP PPID
The process ID of parent process.
.IP ADDR
If in core, the page frame number of the first page of the `u-area' of
the process.
If swapped out, the position in the swap area
measured in multiples of 512 bytes.
.IP RSS
Resident set size \- the number of physical page frames allocated
to this process.

If text is pure, pointer to location of text table entry.
.IP CLKT
Countdown for
.IR alarm (2)
measured in seconds.
.PD
.TP
.B \-u
print information about a user process;
the next argument is its address as given
by
.IR oops (8).
The process must be in main memory, or the file used can
be a core image and the address 0.
.TP
.B \-f
Print the open file table with these headings:
.IP LOC
The core location of this table entry.
.PD 0
.IP FLG

.IP INO
The location of the inode table entry for this file.
.IP OFFS

.IR lseek (2).
.PD
.PP
.B \-s
print information about swap space usage: the number of (1k byte) pages used
and free is given as well as the number of used pages which belong
to text images.
.PP
.B \-T
prints the number of used and free slots in the several system tables
and is useful for checking to see how full system tables have become if the
system is under heavy load.
