.TH MKFS 8 
.SH NAME
mkfs, mkbitfs, mklost+found \- construct a file system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/mkfs
special size
.PP
.B /etc/mkbitfs
special size
.PP
.B /etc/mklost+found
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mkfs
.RI ( mkbitfs )
constructs a regular (bitmapped) file system
by writing on the special file
.IR special .
.I Size
is the number of 1K (4K)
blocks on the special file.
The resulting file system has a single empty directory.
The number of i-nodes is calculated as a function of the filesystem size.
.PP
Immediately after creating a file system,
.I mklost+found
should be run to create a repository for disconnected
files recovered by
.IR fsck (8).
If the special file is
.I /dev/disk
and its mount point
.IR /mnt ,
.I mklost+found
works as follows:
.nf
.IP
/etc/mount /dev/disk /mnt
cd /mnt
/etc/mklost+found
.fi
.PP
.I Mkfs
(only) also has capabilities for assembling a prototype file system,
but this code has not been exercised in years.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
filsys(5),
fsck(8)
.SH BUGS
There should be some way to specify bad blocks.
.br
.I Mkfs
and
.I mkbitfs
should make
.I lost+found
automatically.
