.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Weather
reports current weather conditions and a forecast for towns
in the contiguous United States.
It reads town names from the standard input, one per line.
Each input line should be of the form
.IP
walla walla, wa
.LP
where the state is given as the 2-letter Post Office abbreviation.
.PP
The information provided is the temperature, humidity, whether or not it
is raining or snowing, and an indication of cloudiness and visibility
if it is not.
If the wind is above 10 knots the wind speed and
direction are given.
Up to three forecasts are given (assuming they can be found within
a 4x4 degree latitude-longitude square): a forecast of high
and low temperatures plus probability of precipitation taken from
some numerical model of the atmosphere, a general area forecast
and a marine forecast (if near the coast and if the
.B \-m
argument is given).
.PP
To just get a local forecast,
the command
.B "weather \-h"
is equivalent to
.I weather
followed by a single input
line of
.I "Murray Hill, NJ."
.SH BUGS
Not all the available information is used yet: we hope
cumulative precipitation will be added, and additional
forecasts will be included.
