for reading
(if
.I mode
is 0),
writing (if

(if

.I Name
is the address of a string of ASCII characters representing
a path name, terminated by a null character.

The returned file descriptor must be used for subsequent calls
for other input-output functions on the file.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
creat(2), read(2), write(2), dup(2), close(2)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The value \-1 is returned
if the file does not exist,
if one of the necessary directories
does not exist or is unreadable, if the file is not
readable (resp. writable), the name is too long, or if too many files are open.
.SH BUGS
It should be possible to optionally open files for writing with exclusive use,
and to optionally call
.I open
without the possibility of hanging waiting for carrier on communication lines.
