.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Name
points to a null-terminated string.
.I Unlink
removes the entry for the file pointed to by
.I name
from its directory.
If this entry was the last link to the file,
the contents of the file are freed and the file is destroyed.
If, however, the file was open in any process, the actual
destruction is delayed until it is closed, even though
the directory entry has disappeared.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
rm(1), link(2)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Zero is normally returned;
\-1 indicates that the file does not
exist, that its directory cannot be written,
or that the file contains pure procedure text
that is currently in use.
Write permission is not required on the file itself.
It is also illegal to unlink a directory
(except for the super-user).
