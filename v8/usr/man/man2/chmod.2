.PP
If an executable file is set up for sharing (this is the default)
then mode 1000 prevents the system from
abandoning the swap-space image of the program-text portion
of the file when its last user
terminates.
Ability to set this bit is restricted to the super-user
since swap space is consumed
by the images.
.PP
Only the owner of a file (or the super-user) may change the mode.
Only the super-user can set the 1000 mode.

chmod(1)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Zero is returned if the mode is changed;
\-1 is returned if
.I name
cannot be found or if current user
is neither the owner of the file nor the super-user.
