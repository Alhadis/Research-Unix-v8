.TH MV 1 
.SH NAME
mv  \-  move or rename files and directories
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mv
file1 file2
.PP
.B mv
file ... directory
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mv
moves (changes the name of)
.I file1
to
.IR file2 .
.PP
If
.I file2
already exists,
it is removed before
.I file1
is moved.
If
.I file2
has a mode which forbids writing,
.I mv
prints the mode (see
.IR chmod (2))
and
reads the standard input to obtain a line;
the move is done only if the line begins with
.BR y .
.PP
In the second form,
one or more
.I files
are moved to the
.I directory
with their original
file-names.
.PP
.I Mv
refuses to move a file onto itself.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
cp(1), chmod(2)
.SH BUGS
If
.I file1
and
.I file2
lie on different file systems,
.I mv
must copy the file and delete the original.
In this case the owner name becomes
that of the copying process and any
linking relationship with other files
is lost.
.br
.I Mv
should have a
.B \-f
option, like
.I rm.
