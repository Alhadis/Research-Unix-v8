.SH NAME
learn \- computer aided instruction about UNIX
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B learn
[
.BR \- directory
]
[ subject [ lesson  [ speed ] ] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Learn
gives CAI courses and practice in the use of UNIX.
To get started
simply type `learn'.
The program will ask questions to find out what
you want to do.
The questions may be bypassed by naming a
.I subject,
and the last
.I lesson
number that
.I learn
told you in the previous session.
You may also include a
.I speed
number that was given with the lesson number
(but without the parentheses that
.I learn
places around the speed number).
If
.I lesson
is `\-', 
.I learn
prompts for each lesson;
this is useful for debugging.
.PP
The
.I subjects
presently handled are
.sp
.nf
      editor
      eqn
      files
      macros
      morefiles
      C
.fi
.PP
The special command
`bye' terminates a 
.I learn
session.
.PP
The
.BI \- directory
option allows one to exercise a script in
a nonstandard place.
.SH FILES
/usr/learn and all dependent directories and files
.SH BUGS
The main strength of
.I learn,
that it asks the student to use the real
UNIX, also makes possible baffling mistakes.
It is helpful, especially for nonprogrammers,
to have a UNIX initiate near at hand during the first
sessions.
.PP
Occasionally lessons are incorrect, sometimes because the local version
of a command operates in a non-standard way.
Such lessons may be skipped,
but it takes some sophistication to recognize
the situation.
