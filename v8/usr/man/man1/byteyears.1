may be reasonable candidates for deletion.

.I byteyears
reports (recursively) on everything in that
directory.
If no arguments are given, the current directory is assumed.
If the
.B \-a
option is given, the time since last access
is used instead of the time since last modification.
.PP
Each line of output contains
the number of byte years (rounded to the nearest integer),
the size of the file in bytes, the time last
modified, and the name of the file.
