.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ul
replaces backspaced, overstruck underscores by control sequences suitable
for the terminal given by the environment variable
TERM or by option
.BR \-t .
It reads from the standard input or the named files and
writes on the standard output.
Option
.B \-i
represents underlining by a separate line of `\-' characters.
.PP
.I Hp
is a filter that presents most
.IR nroff
output sensibly on HP 2600 series terminals.
Option
.B \-s
stops and waits for a newline at the beginning of each page.
Option
.B \-e
uses `display enhancement' features to distinguish
underlines, superscripts, and subscripts,
which are normally all shown in inverse video.
Option
.B \-m
squeezes multiple newlines out of the output.

.SH BUGS

does not reliably handle reverse line feeds as produced
by

pipe the input through
.I col
to get rid of them; see
.IR column (1).
