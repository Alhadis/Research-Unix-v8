.SH DESCRIPTION

copy files between machines over Datakit.

.I files
from the local machine
to the directory
.I remotedir
on the named
.I machine.
.I Pull
copies
.I files
from the named
.I machine
to the directory
.I localdir
on the local machine.
The last component of the name of a copy is the same
as that of the original.
If one of the

is a directory, a corresponding
directory is created
and the directory's files are copied, recursively.
.PP
Option
.B \-v
announces each file as it is copied.

Pushing and pulling involve two programs running in
different contexts on different machines.
In particular, pulling
to directory 
.RB ` . '
puts files in the local current directory,
but pushing to
.RB ` . '
puts files in the remote home directory.
Shell metacharacters which are to be interpreted
on the remote machine must be quoted.
.SH FILES
/usr/lib/Rpull and /usr/lib/Rpush, links to /usr/bin/pull and
/usr/bin/push, handle the remote end of transactions.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
