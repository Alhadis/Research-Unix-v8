.TH DRUM 4
.SH NAME
drum \- paging device
.SH SYNOPSIS
This file refers to the paging device in use by the system.
This may actually be a subdevice of one of the disk drivers, but in
a system with paging spread across multiple disk drives or interleaved
will be an indirect driver.

.SH BUGS
Reads from the drum are not allowed across the interleaving boundaries.
Since these only occur every
.BR . 5Mbytes
or so,
and since the system never allocates blocks across the boundary,
this is usually not a problem.
