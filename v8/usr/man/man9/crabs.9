.SH DESCRIPTION
In
.IR crabs ,
difficult situations are encountered in trying to kill or capture 
crustaceans swarming in a murky sea.
You will have to work very
rapidly to keep your territory free of seabed intruders.
At first,
you may even find it hard to keep a clear view of your surroundings, but
later discoveries about the spirit of the game will suggest a solution. 
.PP
There are several options.
.TP
.B \-i
causes the intruders to play intelligently, allowing them to avoid detection.
.TP
.B \-s
simplifies the game for the first
.I duration
time intervals.

you may want to forgo this option the first time, just to see how interesting
it can get.
.TP
.B \-v
adjusts the velocity of the crabs, 1 being fastest.
Default is 5.
.PP
.I Number
specifies the number of intruders.
Default is 30.
