.B pen
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pen
writes on the screen with smooth strokes.
It can scribble on layers or on 
the background, even while other programs are running.
It can be used to make drawings, marks or annotations, or to highlight regions 
in a crowded screen.
.I Pen
never needs refilling.
.PP
To write, press mouse button 1 and keep it pressed while moving the mouse. 
To move around without writing, release the button.
Button 3 controls 
a menu to stop drawing (allowing one to resume normal activities), resume drawing, 
clean up, or exit the program.
.SH BUGS
When drawing too fast, the pen can temporarily run out of ink;
when this happens release
button 1 and press it again.
To avoid this problem, 
make the pen layer bigger (that is where the ink supply is kept).
