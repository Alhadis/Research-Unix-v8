.TH NEWSRC 5
.SH NAME
newsrc \- information file for readnews 
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I .newsrc
file contains the list of previously read articles and an optional
options line for
.IR readnews (1).
Each newsgroup that articles
have been read from has a line of the form:
.LP
.I newsgroup: range
.LP
The
.I range
is a list of the articles read.  It is basically a list of no.'s
separated by commas with sequential no.'s collapsed with hyphens.
For instance:
.LP
.B general: 1-78,80,85-90
.br
.B fa.info-cpm: 1-7
.br
.B net.news: 1
.br
.B fa.info-vax! 1-5
.br
.LP
If the : is replaced with an ! (as in info-vax above) the newsgroup
is not subscribed to and will not be shown to the user.
.LP
An options line starts with the word
.B options
(left-justified).  Then there are the list of options just as they
would be on the command line.  For instance:
.LP
.B "options \-n all !fa.sf-lovers !fa.human-nets \-r"
.br
.B "options \-c \-r"
.LP
A string of lines beginning with a space or tab after the initial options
line will be considered continuation lines.
