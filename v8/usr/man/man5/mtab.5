.TH MTAB 5 
.SH NAME
mtab \- mounted file system table
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mtab
resides in directory
.I /etc
and contains a table of devices mounted by the
.I mount
command.
.I Umount
removes entries.
.PP
Each entry is 64 bytes long;
the first 32 are the null-padded name of the
place where the special file is mounted;
the second 32 are the null-padded name of the special
file.
The special file has all its directories
stripped away;
that is, everything through the last `/' is thrown
away.
.PP
This table is present only so people can look at it.
It does not matter to
.I mount
if there are duplicated entries nor
to
.I umount
if a name cannot be found.
