This is an ASCII file.  Each field within each user's entry
is separated from the next by a colon.
The GCOS field is used only when communicating with that
system, and in other installations can contain
any desired information.
Each user is separated from the next by a new-line.
If the password field is null, no password is demanded;
if the Shell field is null, the Shell itself
is used.
.PP
This file resides in directory /etc.
Because of the encrypted
passwords, it can and does have general read
permission and can be used, for example,
to map numerical user ID's to names.
