in lieu of an adequate makefile, know ye this:
	if you change the value of P or Sys, the following are wrong:
		jerqproc.h, mpx.h
		boot.c
		in /usr/jerq/src/sys, update resume.s and make
		in /usr/jerq/src/mlib, rm *.o and make
		here, rm *.o and make
	if you add entry points in mpx.h and put them at the end of the list,
		all is well.  if you put them in the middle, ALL mcc -m
		binaries will be wrong! then:
		in /usr/jerq/src/mlib, rm *.o and make
		/usr/jerq/src/mlib/exit.c depends on the entry number of exit
		/usr/jerq/include/jerqio.h depends on the entry number of jinit and request
		/usr/jerq/src/lib/ellipse.c depends on the entry number of point
		/usr/jerq/src/lib/elarc.c depends on the entry number of point
	the following depend on jerqproc.h:
		Sys: line in Pl.template
		exec: in boot.c
		files in /usr/jerq/src/sys; just "make" there
			before make'ing here
		menu.o in /usr/jerq/src/lib
		cursor.o in /usr/jerq/src/sys
