Canon printers live on panther and ikeya. To minimize Datakit traffic,
files are sent over the network in compressed form, where they are
(regrettably) expanded and handed over to the printer daemon.

To use, run blitblt in a window to produce a compressed raster file
(default file name is BLITBLT). Then type "bcan filename" to get the
output. If the filename is BLITBLT, "bcan" by itself is sufficient.

Files for blitblt:

Binaries:

blitblt		lives in /usr/blit/bin, host program.

bbterm.m	lives in /usr/blit/mbin, blit side; 68ld'd by blitblt.

bcan.out	lives in panther!/usr/bin, and ikeya!/usr/bin, does format
		conversion and runs ipr to print the result.


Shell scripts:

bcan		lives in /usr/bin, runs bcan.out on panther.
4bcan		linked to bcan, runs bcan.out on ikeya.
