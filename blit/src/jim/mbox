another suggestion for jim:
I often j a list of file and want to go through them sequentially.
It would be nice if I could overlay the current frame with a file from the
button 3 menue.

can  get extra cursors by selecting non-frame

two jim suggestions:
1.  when you select by line number, but the selected line in the middle
of the window, not at the top.
2.  When a region of text is selected, and you use the scroll bar, the
selection is lost.  In fact, it is not obvious where the cursor ends up
after the text has scrolled.

if you haven't done so already, in jim why
don't you make
	e filename
put filename in the window and give you a box,
instead of complaining.
