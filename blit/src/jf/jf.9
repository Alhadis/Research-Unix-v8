.TH JF 9 "Blit / draft"
.SH NAME
jf \- font editor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B jf
[
.I files
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Jf
reads, writes and edits standard Blit font files. It is mostly mouse- and
menu-driven, except when prompting for file names.
.I Jf
divides its layer into two types of areas:
The \fIfont displays\fR show all characters in a given font in actual size; when
characters are opened for editing, they appear magnified in \fIedit displays\fR.
.TP
.B Button 1
is the "do it" button. Clicking button 1 inside a \fIfont display\fR
opens a character for editing; inside an \fIedit display\fR it sets a pixel.
It may also have other functions selected via menus, in which case the function
is indicated by a special icon.
.TP
.B Button 2
is the "undo it" button. Clicking button 2 closes a character or clears a
pixel, unless conditioned otherwise via menu selection.
.TP
.B Button 3
is the "menu" button. Clicking button 3 either selects a menu or pops control
back to the top level. Sometimes menu selection is the only (non-trivial)
option available, as indicated by a "menu" icon.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The most common problem is running out of memory or screen area, in which case
the offending operation is simply ignored. A small
number of self-explanatory messages deal with errors on file I/O.
.SH BUGS
Yes.
.PP
The syntax for creating a new font of given size is quite painful.
