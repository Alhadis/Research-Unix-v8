ump has to be running first.  it expects /dev/pt/ump and /dev/pt/maze
to exist.
mazewar talks to ump and loads maze.m.
maze.m runs in your blit.
Mazewar and rmtmaze are used to run for jerqs on other machines
(other than the ump's)
Mazewar runs on the remote machine, and rmtmaze runs on its behalf on
the ump's machine.
