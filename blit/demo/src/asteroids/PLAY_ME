Welcome to nastyroids, the fun game for filling the hours spent
waiting for compiles, test runs, troffs, prints, and so forth.

You, the hero, are the little pointy thing in the middle.
The enemy are those jaggedies floating about.  If one of them
floats too close to you, you will be smashed.  You may be able to
avoid this fate and acquire valuable Points by using the controls.
The middle button shoots tiny but deadly projectiles at the horrid
jaggedies.  When you hit a giant jaggedy you get a whole point,
and the giant jaggedy splits into two middling jaggedies.  If you
hit a middling jaggedy, you get two points, and the jaggedy splits
into two tiny jaggedies.  Hitting a tiny jaggedy destroys it,
and gets you five points.

While you hold the left button down, the pointy you will rotate left.
While you hold the right button down, the pointy you will rotate right.
Should you hold both of these buttons down, a tiny motivator thrusts you
in the direction you are pointing.

Artificial aids are available should life become too hectic.
Pushing the `c' key turns on the stupid yet powerful battle computer
and lights the `C' status panel.
The stupid yet powerful battle computer decides which jaggedies will
run into you, and tries to kill them.  Pushing the `s' key turns on
the incredibly powerful screens, and lights the `S' status panel.
Whenever the screens sense a nearby threat, they destroy it.
This is very protective, but costs six points.  Pushing the `r'
key turns off the artificial aids, and clears the status panels.
You can still use the controls while the aids are on, but the
stupid aids will take over if they sense danger, correctly or not.
The stupid artificial aids don't work well unless the little pointy
thing is at rest.
