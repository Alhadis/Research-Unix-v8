Blit Diagnostic ROM

1)  Munching squares (continuous run).  At each half cycle the next prime number
is chosen for the munch parameter.  This part requires only that ROM work - non-
functioning RAM merely looks bad.  Terminated by carriage return.

2)  Longword bit test (continuous run).  Starting with bit 31, which is also
chip 31, vertical lines are drawn using the selected bit.  Requires only that
ROM work.  Terminated by carriage return.

3)  Byte bit test (continuous run).  Same as before but with byte writes.

4)  Keyboard output test.  Rings the bell and counts to 127 using the keyboard
lights.

5)  Keyboard test (2 parts).  Displays typed keys on the screen.  The first part
of the test uses polling, while the second part uses interrupts.  Both tests are
terminated by carriage return.

6)  Mouse test (2 parts).  Displays an 'A' (polled) or a 'B' (interrupt) at the
current mouse position.  The interrupt test is driven by the 60Hz field interrupt.
If a mouse button is pressed, one of '1', '2', or '3' is displayed in the upper
left hand corner.  Terminated by carriage return.

7)  Bouncing square (continuous run).  A small rectangle bounces around the screen
exclusive-ORing itself with the picture.  A lot of different code is used for this
test, and the RAM is very heavily exercised.  This is probably the best test to
be running during burn in.  Carriage return sends the program back to munching
squares.

N.B:  None of these tests exercise the RS232 line.  A terminal that passes these
tests still has to prove itself a terminal.
