I gather you have got as much mail from ark as I.  I believe that the
situation is as follows.  Andy's library will work when compiled on
the vax and run on the 68000.  It will probably work when compiled
on any machine.  Programs using Andy's library will probably work
when compiled on the vax and run on the 68000.  My compiler, as
on your tape, will not work if run on the 68000 itself or on
the 3B.  Also, there are a couple of relatively obscure bugs in the
floating-point conversions.

I don't see anything wrong with distributing the compiler and library
with these caviats; let the buyer beware about anything else.
