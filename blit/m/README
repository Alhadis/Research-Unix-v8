the source for /usr/blit/lib/ccom has been lost.
the source here (Mip and Mcc) is for a compiler that does not generate
the correct symbol tables for joff and pi.
we wish we had the source, but we don't, so the binary is precious.
please handle it with care.

if you decide you need to recompile ccom, contact us.
we may have found a solution by then...
