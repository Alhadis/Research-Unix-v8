There are three kinds of stab entries:

	stabs	"symbol",code,c_type,expression

Defines a symbol.  Code is an absolute expression
known to sdb that tells what kind.
c_type is the type in the what I hope is pcc's usual encoding.
The last expression is the `value' of the symbol.
It will be absolute for automatics and register and relocatable for statics
and defined externs.
Currently it must be defined in the current assembly,
not external-undefined or common (only),
but I think this can be changed if need be.

	stabn	code,c_type,expression

Same as

	stabs	"", ...

(There are entries which need no name)

	stabd	code,line#

Used for line-number, block markers, and the like.
It is the same as

	stabn	"",code,line,L%x
L%x:
