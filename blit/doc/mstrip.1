.SH NAME
mstrip \- remove symbol tables
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mstrip
[ option ] ... file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION

removes the symbol tables stored in object programs.
This saves file space and also significant real time on later processing by
.I jx
and
.I 68ld,
``after the program has been debugged''.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-g

Source line numbers are not retained.
.TP
